When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!

Tucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call ""cozy"" or ""charming"" - basically any euphemism for small.

That being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:

* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.
* it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them.
* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to ""just look around"" and ""do whatever."" 

At such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.",5.0,OwjRMXRC0KyPrIlcjaXeFQ

My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn't. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said ""you know what? That's fine."", paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.

I am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.

I ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.

The ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.

Tldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.

Update: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji. This is hands down the best Indian place in Pittsburgh - the bhaji is to die for. Make sure you sprinkle lemon on top and have the pav with mango chutney.",3.0,6sJN_HlM_uwpfLJ1puf1Fg

I just came back from Vegas this morning and a truly truly horrible experience.  I only went out there for a concert and the concert and this restaurant were the best parts of my trip.  I went in here accidentally, meaning, i had no clue it was Bobby Flay's restaurant. I was hungry and Caesars Palace was a across from where I was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, I walked right in with no waiting. (I will assume now that since its Bobby's place this place can get crowded so I feel the need to note this was a Sunday about 11:45am) Once inside Caesars Palace, I went to the first restaurant I saw, which was this one.  I realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that ""Mr Flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick"" (they were an older couple). I know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.

FOOD: fantastic.  I went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  It came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). I am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  I had a side of home fries which were a little burnt but oh well.  The steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. Overall very good. Had a cappuccino too, also very good. I wish i had tried the crabcake's but i knew i wasnt going to eat all that. waiters were awesome, just the right amount of attentiveness. (I personally hate when waiters/waitresses, come back every 5 minutes, is everything ok is everything ok...sheesh can i enjoy my meal?) 

Anyway like i said, i had a horrible experience in vegas and this and the concert i went to see were the best parts about my trip, very glad i blessed up on this place.

P.S.  Take notice, i have never eaten in a celebrity chef's restaurant and noticed that there were no salt and pepper shakers on any table.  ha just a fun tidbit, i thought that was funny and very interesting, almost as if the chef is subtly saying ""you will not mess up my dish with your spices""",0.0,-Co-ReNx_lXT1xL_Rr0B2g

ATMOSPHERE: Small space. Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. Vibe is casual. Free WiFi is nice.

SERVICE: Okay. Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.

PRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order.The small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one VERY hungry person.  Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)


FOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. It wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them. Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. So will definitely come back.

Here's the pizza we ordered:

Peking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well. But it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.

Margherita - Good, but not the best. I recommend trying the more ""special"" toppings instead.

There are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.

The biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. 

The ""Space Lounge"" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.

With their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their ""big draw"" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.

The arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  

There's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was ""ha ha"" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.

Ladies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.

As critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called ""Triumph"" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.

The sad part is, Hilton's one of those ""history rich"" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.

This place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.",5.0,H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg

Today I had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  As I was getting off of I-85, I noticed the smell of burning oil.  I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.
I pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!
I have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.
I called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.

And NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.  No transmission service, no brake service, no rotation, no cooling flush... just an oil change.  I hope he remembered to tighten the filter, but I am skeptical at this point.

Unfortunately the only good thing I have to say about the place is it has nice decor. We walked in and was greeted by one of the girls and as we were looking at the menu she asked if it was our first time and we told her yes. We assumed she would explain the menu but nope! My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as
we looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. To
me the best part was the granola and that's about it. At least we can say we finally tried this place and we definitely won't be back. We will be sticking to our usual spot Bowlology!",0.0,wGiUu3rFw83EDj8bzMzsuQ

Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.

The ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.

Our waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation.

Let's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.

I ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi/sashimi/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi/sashimi/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.

Everything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi/sashimi/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.

What probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant.

While the store did not have my size in stock, Mia brought me shoes made from the same mold and informed me that not only could the size I need (11) be mailed to my home, but it could be accomplished with no tax and free shipping since I lived in Ohio.

In retrospect I wish I'd have bought more pairs of shoes while I was there, but as it stands they've guaranteed I'll return on my next Vegas visit.",3.0,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA

I was immediately impressed upon ordering at Bang Bang Burgers. I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!
I don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. 
The sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. 
Overall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight ""drawbacks"", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.",2.0,aLqp_fe64ugZFuwMpsXLiw

I stopped here late after work one night on the way home after having passed it at least a thousand times, and decided to give it a try. I went in, placed my order, and after about 15 minutes, was on my way home. 

The inside is cozy, there is a new hookah lounge upstairs (not technically the same business), for those who might be interested in that. The tables inside were pretty low key, but the kitchen area is open except for some glass, so you get to watch your food prepared while you wait which is always a nice touch. Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. 

The young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly. The gentleman who gave me my food, apologized for the wait (15 minutes is not long in my book, but maybe for some it is), and said that calling ahead is a great option if you're ever in a hurry in the future. 

I ordered a lamb and chicken shish kabob. They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored. The green sauce that was at the counter where you pick up your food was perfectly spiced and I put it on EVERYTHING! I appreciate the fresh lemon wedge that was included in my to-go container. 

My only real complaint was the price. It was more than $17 for two kabobs, which I thought was on the expensive side. If they took their prices down around $2, I'd be here way more often that is good for my wallet...",4.0,xFSLb_pxXta5G4oaRB1ylQ

The food was solid. The prime rib was balanced with just the perfect amount of richness and seasoning. I ordered a medium and it was a true medium- the edges were seasoned and done well while the interior was still a soft pink and juicy. My date loved the Yorkshire pudding, I wasn't really a fan, but it was airy and puffed up to perfection. The mushrooms were rich and earthy, the perfect accompaniment. The mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and deliciously well seasoned. No bland taters here.

Sweet Potato Pancakes: these were very interesting and not what I expected. They appear to be deep fried pouches of a sweet potato purée-like filling. The balance between crunchy outside and gooey inside is a nice balance. These are only slightly sweet and I wish weren't so oily.

Beef in Lettuce Cup: the plating was nice but not sure how they got ""cups"". I expected lettuce  wraps but received beef with lettuce pieces. I could not scoop then into lettuce cups as the lettuce was chopped too much. Flavor wise this was DELICIOUS! I highly recommend this if you want a lighter low carb dinner, and it's much cheaper than the entrees and the portion isn't too much!

Really???? What a great way to handle an error in the production of the glasses.  When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was...""Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now.""  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.  After the poor response to the problem (you would think they would have some professional way to deal with when glasses come back from the mfr/lens maker and there is an unexpected issue).  I told them I'm not a patient here any longer and took my useless glasses home and resolved to find a quality optometry office and start over.  I did call back and spoke with an Office Mgr, who stated she would look into the matter and get back to me, but never did.  So I called again and toild them to toss my file out and not contact me again for any future appts. 
 Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.

We got a newspaper flyer from them last week and decided to check it out, based on that.  Still, I kept thinking, isn't this the place [friends of ours] went to and said wasn't that great??

The produce is priced well but it seems like everything else is on the high side.  Bulk food section was small-ish, I though.  I meant to bring a pen and paper to write down prices of items I usually buy, to compare RBN, WF, TJ's, and EEFCO - but forgot.  But long grain brown rice was $1.99 here, which is same as EEFCO.  I think walnuts are more at RBN, though.  Basically - don't believe the low price claims!

I think we may go back for produce and that may be it.  Free parking is nice, though - they cover 2 hours, which would give you a little time to wander, too.  Parking is covered which is oh so nice.

One negative for families is no changing table in the bathrooms.   I had to change a diaper  on the floor of the bathroom on my husband's coat.  Yeah, the floor was pretty clean, but still.  Ugh.  Not a good thing for families!

We ate here on the day before New Year's Eve so that may have been why we easily got a reservation at prime dinner time.  Everything from start to finish was pretty much impeccable. 

Sourdough bread in the shape of leaves were brought out immediately with softened butter in a small ramekin.  One thing I hate is when warm bread is brought out with butter that is ice cold and hard to spread on the bread, so I really appreciated that the butter was the right temperature to easily spread.

For a starter, we split the Terrine of foie gras which was delicious.  It has a thin layer of braised beef ground down to a coarse pate texture, then a thin layer of foie gras, then a layer of prune gelee.  Served with crostini and a small frisee salad.  The slightly slightly saltier beef and the creamy foie went so well together. The prune gelee added that touch of cool sweetness that made it all work together.  A dish I would definitely recommend.

For our entrees, I got the Steak frites, and Mark H had the Leg of lamb (Gigot d'Agneau.)  Mine was hangar steak topped with caramelized onions served with a compound butter and a healthy portion of nicely crispy, thinly cut fries.  The steak was cooked to a perfect mid rare and was tender.  The onions and the compound butter did overpower the steak a bit, though.

Mark H's dish on the other hand, was the better of the two.  The roasted leg of lamb was just so tender and flavorful,  the knife cut through the meat like butter.  The lamb was served with flageolet beans and braised escarole.  Our server asked him when he was ordering if he wanted any sides to go with it since it didn't come with a starch but the beans and escarole was enough for an entree portion.  Besides, I know he wanted to save room for dessert.

For dessert, we split the Banana crepe gateau.  Layers of crepes with banana pastry cream between them, served with salted caramel and french vanilla gelato.   This was pretty amazing as well.  I've had some fantasic gateau de crepes in france and this one really reminded me of being there.  The banana flavor was a bit too subtle for me but that salted caramel was like heaven.  Such an incredible texture to it with that bright kick of salt, damn.  The french vanilla gelato was memorable as well.  Nice silky texture and oh so creamy.

It was just what I wanted. 

The one wrinkle was that I wanted to swap something out of my salad for avocado instead (which came with the grilled shrimp salad but I wanted salmon, and not shrimp). The server told me they didn't do ""those kinds of substitutions"" but would check anyway. He came back, and affirmed that they couldn't put avocado on my salad unless they charged an extra $2.00. Kind of annoying. I get that if you're Terroni you can have a ""no substitutions"" policy but in this case, how about changing that policy? 

The server really made an effort though, and said he'd bring over some guacamole instead. That was much appreciated :)

I was so excited there was a Vig being built right in my neighborhood. I watched the construction progress on my way to and fro work. I told my friends who didn't know about the Vig how awesome it was and how excited I was to have one close. It was going to be my number one go to place.  I have been going to Local Bistro, Modern Sports Grill in DC ranch and Isabell's. Now there would e a Vig which is closer and better.

I went to the Vig and it was ok, I figured they had just opened and they were still hiring and getting organized.  I went  again. Food was great, bummer no band due to Scottsdale rules but DJ is nice. Service ok but its busy on a Friday. I went again, food great as always but service still lacking. I figured its just busy. At this point I had gone 4 Friday nights in a row. Its close great food and I have always loved the Vig. 

I don't get why I have to wait so long to get a drink at the bar. I don't understand why once I get a drink, I'm not offered a refill or second round. I'm trying to unwind on a Friday night, I don't want to have to work to get the bartenders attention to get a drink. 

Ok had my cocktails, now time for dinner. The food has always been great. Good taste, good variety on the menu, priced fair. Why does it take so long to put in my dinner order? If I have been there 5-7 times, I have had to wait to order too long maybe 5 times. The food comes out quickly enough and luckily its good since the wait staff doesn't check back. 

My friends and coworkers know I go out to eat quite a bit. I am often asked for recommendations, I had said to go to the Vig but I feel I can't recommend it anymore. If anything I would say to go somewhere else.

There was another couple sitting outside (they only had 2 tables with 2 little chairs outside, so not much of a patio incase anyone was curious). 

Anywho, me and my boyfriend took a couple of minutes to decide what to try because there were at least 30 flavors to choose from. The small and medium give you 2 flavors to try from, the large gives you 3. He chose the small with coconut and mango gelato and I had the small Oreo and dolce de leche. 

The coconut tasted AMAZING. But the mango was the show stopper, it was amazing. To anyone who loves the fruit, this is just as good if not better (yes, I went there!)

The Oreo tasted like plain vanilla. I barely tasted any cookie pieces. So avoid it unless you want a plain vanilla taste. The dolce de leche was really good, a little on the sweet side but still enjoyable.

There is no excuse for that kind of thing at a hotel especially where there is no self park option.  Ended up parking across the street at the mall to check in, ridonkulous.

The service at the front desk was good to great, they were apologetic about the valet and whenever I called down for my car (once I was able to valet my car), they fought to have my car ready by the time I got down.  Accommodations are decent, nice big jet tubs, good sized rooms and a mini kitchenette in the studios to boot because these are condotel units.  The location, despite being off strip, is workable because you're walking distance to the Wynn and directly across the street from Fashion Show.  If you're staying here, you probably don't want a casino and so being next to fashion show is a plus.  

I can't stress how understaffed this hotel seemed to be and so I probably won't stay here again if I'm paying the same price as a on-strip 4star hotel.  I was able to book at a $100 discount to other comparable hotels with a casino though so something to keep in mind.",0.0,liJS3rpRalcZM4G-uHZLjw

A. Of course you are "" lost why I feel that way."" You think its normal to answer a phone call  at a place of business with the greeting ""Speak"" and reply to questions with ""what the hell are you talking about""'

B. You do not remember anything. I never said anything about 3% or California.

The original location was at about 52nd McDowell(it was a treat after squaw peak hike with da)( but they have been at the current location for probably the last 20 years. They have a good mix of North Indian and South Indian food. Masala dosas have always been one of my favorites things to get. The vegies and sambar are always fresh as well. The title may not say it here but they are just as famous for all the amazing sweets they make as well. Indians from all over town order it by the tray but if you arent sure what you want to order ask them to sample it. Jalebi barfi and laddu are some of my go to's. I'm an american born and raised indian so I'm suggesting some of the more tame whitewashed options. The service is quick and the staff is always attentive. You'll see an crowd of ASU kids definitely during cricket matches but they also have indian music videos playing throughout the day. Before I forget my favorite thing to get from there to go is pani puri!. Picture a cracker like hollow bubble with potatoes chickpeas and a spicy sauce. yes my mouth is watering just describing it. I put in mint chutney and tamardind chutney. Im confident you have will a few items that you love and will have again and again.,0.0,N_IFBJrVN5CVRNi4UmKf1g

Having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming.  Like the music, I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and/or creativity over all else.  For my taste buds, this was overload.  Interesting yes, but I can't say I found it good.
Here are some details:  
Pasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial.  I prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi.  Maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal.
Sauces - Here is the in-your-face part.  The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).  Despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better.
The le Sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because I love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. I could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise.  And what is with the dried hunks of bread?  I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.  
The carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three.  Even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity.
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.  The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.  The ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality.  And the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti/lasagna place.
As a matter of taste, I'm going to have to pass on Pasta Bar.  For the price, I'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony.  If culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out.",3.0,yMI4vNI5CWoJWmqjxJRD1A

I would give this place a strong 4 stars for food and atmosphere. The place had a very nice atmosphere though was a bit loud. 

The reason for the 3 stars was the service. While they were extremely nice when asked for anything, we had to ask, often. Missing parts of our orders, incorrect items on check and a standard dinner of drinks, apps, and entrees took over 2 hours. A few more servers would really bring this place up a notch.

We played a few rounds and then she let us jump privately because there was no party after us.
The place feels so clean. They have a free place for your shoes and belongings and seats all around so you can watch your kids jump if you aren't jumping too, where at Sky Zone you see parents standing at the entrance or sitting on the ground in those narrow walkways. The regular jump area is nice and open and they have a separate netted off area for younger kids that the parents can also jump in. Unlike Sky Zone that have small kids to one side, 8-10 yr olds in the middle and adults to the other side.

You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago.

I learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.

The menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck/veal/lamb/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. 

My eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was ""not a mistake"". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money.

I was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or crème caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!",6.0,JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg

This place is vegan/vegetarian and they serve no meat.. What? Yes. I tell my bestie every single time that they should put quotes around all their meat products so people don't get so darn confused. Their meat, it's not real- but trust me, it's a good thing. Especially when it just hits the table, it'll have you scratching your head. Once it cools, the ""meat"" starts to get a bit of texture, but it still pretty great. If you have the thing and you can't do textures, you're probably safer sticking to something with veggies instead.

All the food I've had here has been really great, even if the service is a little shoddy. Don't let that deter you.

We had made reservations for a busy Friday night but due to circumstances out of our control - we called & let them know that we were running a half an hour late! Well Ms. Carolynn Stevenson greeted us as we again apologized for our tardiness. She immediately put us at ease, told us she would get us seated as soon as possible, and show us to the bar. We waited maybe ten minutes when we were called and seated! Our server turned out to be - in our opinion - the BEST - Mun Froilan!!!!!! If you want the most awesome dining experience then ask for him when you make your reservation!!! It is a must! He makes you feel as if you are the one and only guests he has to please and take care of and everything he did he seemed to truly enjoy! The restaurant's décor is a 1930's-40's era which I love since the staff's attire also reflects that time period. You start off with the artisan bread (OMG - SO SO DELISH) and their famous spinning salad. The prime rib just melts in your mouth! The cuts we had were good size - Mun made sure of that! - and I had the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach which was so fabulous. The dessert cart that he wheeled out looked amazing but we couldn't fit another morsel of food in our mouths! Highly recommend this GREAT restaurant!",1.0,kTz1vf_yrcmTPdWta9QIpQ

   There is a giant cheese/milk production facility right behind your store and you can't make some more curds or make some more cheese that makes more curds available.

Only friends and family were invited. We felt very special- either to be considered part of the Spicy Pickle family, or maybe because we made such ridiculous fools of ourselves at the window that they thought we might be ""special"" in the other meaning. Perhaps.
Either way, free lunch.

It's not as though I could give a stinky review to anything given to me for free- I might feel bad- but this was just what the doctor ordered. 

Not for the weak at heart.

It's not just a clever name. Their pickles are actually spicy. They seems to be lightly dusted with some kind of chile powder. A nice kick follows a good bite.

I ordered the Dilly something or other. It was half a sandwich (sub or panini) with a bowl of soup. I chose the Corn and Green Chile Bisque with the Sausalito Bandito panini. Delish! It also passed my spicy- enough- for- me- test. Yes, I needed multiple napkins for my nose.
I could have taken a little more spice, so next time I might ask them to kick it up a notch, but it was a refreshing foray back to my traveling days when I tried to convince a chef in India that, no, I am actually not white. I just have REALLY light skin. Never worked.

Al had the Aztec pizzeti. Coming from NY, I am particular about pizza. This looked like it fit the bill. Very think and crispy crust. A little too much cheese for my taste, but most people out here like it like that. She loved it, along with her bowl of loaded potato soup.

Mickey had the Gobbler with a side salad. When she bit into the panini she made a face that I think should remain in the bedroom. Enough said.

Bryan had the salad and enjoyed it immensely. It didn't look like much, but I might have to return when they open tomorrow and try it out for myself. The croutons did look very appetizing.

One of the attentive staff members made the rounds with a tray of mini chocolate chip cookies. Fantastic. Crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Mama like.

All in all, I'll be back. Probably tomorrow. And maybe the day after...

AMENDMENT:
OK, so I did go back the next day... and today (which is the following day). Yesterday I had the tuna salad, which was delish. Theur tuna is a little kicked up, as it's made with chipotle mayo (but really not too much) and spoicy pickle relish. Tasty. It was served over a bed of greens with a lemon olive oil dressing.
Today I had the med sub. It was ok- nothing out of the ballpark. I got it with the spoinach salad, which was also delish. 

Down to 4.5, but alas no halfs...

Stick with the paninis and the salads. Maybe the soups too. I have yet to try the pizzetti... stay tuned.",5.0,2TAvvTz9E6AOYObB9OOjaw

The last time I came here, while they tried to accommodate me and fix the issue, the fries were hard and not salted enough and the burger tasted very bad.  This is rare and that's why I'm only docking one star, but for some reason, one of the fry cooks didn't add salt to the fries and they always have before.  The cashier said you could ask for salt, but what frustrated me is that they were always perfectly salted before and while I understand some people will say it's too salty, you can't go from quite salty to no salt at all. That's quite the change.  I have to say, all the bad times I was there, there was one consistency on who was making the food, but I don't want to say who, as they are making a living.

The drinks were so affordable! Hooch hour starts after 10pm so all shots were 2$ each and 5$ bar rails! I like the fact that the end of the restaurant turns into a dance floor after maybe 11pm if memory serves me right and they played awesome music the night I was there.

We bought an air-conditioner from them in 2014 and one just last summer in 2015.  We've had nothing but problems since the very first day we had it installed.  Not only that, but the guy who comes out is completely rude and his office seems to back him up.  This is a unit which holds 5-tons of Puron so it is pretty big and it's not cheap.  We spent $5000 on the unit and it is still under warranty.  It's a good thing, too, because these people have had to replace it once and now it's compressor just blew yesterday morning.  It had been making horrible noises and shutting down and about a week ago, they came out and replaced the thermostat and the air seemed to work, but it was making an even more horrible noise than before and then 2 nights ago it stopped working altogether again.  So, it just so happens that my roommate was going to call them yesterday, anyway, to come out and fix it AGAIN.  However, before he did, all of a sudden, I heard the loudest BOOM!  I mean, it was like a bomb going off and literally was louder than a shotgun being fired close by.  Then, it had this awful constant noise - like I've never heard before and vapor was coming out of the hose by the valve and there was a funny smell and I didn't know what was going on and I panicked because I wasn't sure if it was smoke or Puron or what so I ran into the house, turned off all of the units, made sure all of our cats were okay and ran back outside real quick with fire-extinguishers just in case it was smoke.  My roommate called them and they said they'd be there within the hour.  Two hours later, a little after noon, the guy shows up and says it's the compressor that totally blew and he'd have to order another one and that they were going to charge $1200 for labor for the 5-hour job it was going to take to do it.  The compressor, itself, is still under warranty.  He tried to say that the problem was our faulty electrical and that it was on our end, therefore, they were not at all to blame for this.  Also, he said this was a completely different issue than the thermostat, which he claimed was a good call and that he did fix that problem correctly.  So, we hired an electrician (one who is extremely reputable) to come out and assess the situation because if it was our end, we knew we needed to not only get it fixed immediately for safety reasons, but I may have owed the guy an apology for insinuating this could have been their fault to begin with.  The electrician came and his findings were that #1, the units were too close to one another to begin with and that after checking the voltages, etc. with his do-hicky (LOL), his findings showed there was not one problem with our electricity, no surges or imbalanced distributions of power, no breaker problems, etc. on our end and he even called his friend who owns another air-conditioning company and his friend told him that had it been on our end it would have not only showed up in his readings, but it would have had to be a surge large enough to, at the very least, surge other electronic items in our home and that really...  it would more realistically be an outage-type surge where other neighbors would also have been affected.  Not only that, but both agreed that there's no way that it should be a 5-hour job to replace a compressor and that the money they were telling us they were going to charge was outlandish.  This electrician made a point of including some of this on the invoice and gave us the contact information of his friend in case we needed additional assistance with this matter.  Thank God for him and for Yelp and all the Yelpers out there who recommended him. :)

Unless you're going to fill up on side dishes, don't expect to get any value for your money at all.  The place suffers from an identity crisis, part night club part overpriced buffet.

The food is entirely average, nothing spectacular but what absolutely stands out is the fact that every portion of meat I was given was entirely bite size, I literally had already eaten the meat given to me before the guy had even left the table.  I often had to wait 5-10 minutes between 'bites' as they were very busy.

The meat was either extremely overcooked or border line raw (I like rare, this was nearly blue).  As I'm from Texas, I've eaten a substantial amount of cornbread and I can honestly say this was sugar with food colouring and a tea spoon of cornmeal.

We ordered caipirinha's and it was like drinking lime flavoured water with ice and a 1/4 shot of Chacas.

Deciding not to go with a burger for the umpteenth time, I instead chose the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sandwich, which comes complete with a pineapple ring, a drape of provolone cheese, and roasted red peppers. It's shame that the exquisitely tender chicken didn't smack much of jerk seasoning, though. Nonetheless, sweet, savory, tart, and creamy cavorted brilliantly together within a Sunday dinner-worthy Kaiser roll on a Saturday night. A flawless pile of housemade, kettle-plunged, perfectly salted potato chips complimented the soft and juicy sandwich with their inherent crunch factor. 

A domineering cleat of an after-dinner treat, the Snickers Ice Cream Pie had me bug-eyed upon its arrival, something my wonderful server (name forgotten) got a laugh out of. 

Carvel had nothing on this monstrosity of vanilla and chocolate ice cream that was garnished with nuts, candy pieces, and sauces of the caramel, white chocolate, and dark chocolate varieties. An Oreo crust would hold this sundae-on-a-plate together, bringing more texture as well as stability to this luscious, saccharine, bon-bon-riddled masterpiece of frozen confection. 

With quick, courteous, adept service and above average bar food, Lot 17 has hollowed out a deserved niche for itself in this restaurant-heavy area of Pittsburgh. Considering I have credit left on that card and that Hot Card participants are dwindling, I may be overdue for another visit, and it will be without a hint of reluctance, Lot 17 proving itself to be a sturdy dining option in a neighborhood with much...

I gotta say the flavours of Georgian cuisine is quite unique. These dishes seemed to be made to order because it took quite some time to receive. It may have been more than half an hour.
My favorite would be the hachapuri. It makes me think of having pizza but the cheese is distinctly salty and they roll up the boat edges with cheese so the crust is a delight to eat. I wish there were 2 eggs. It definitely balanced the saltiness of the cheese (feta?). It seemed like there were 2 layers of cheese: the crusty top and a layer of soft chese below.
The khinkali reminds me of Chinese dumplings but the flavours are truly very different from what I'm used to. It was creamy and dark. Each serving contained 3 dumplings  which doesn't seem like a lot but it really is like its own meal. It definitely needed something to cut the heaviness.
While waiting for the food, we got complimentary appetizers: bread, pickled cabbage and an array of sauces (tomato, Georgian, spicy).

6 hours round trip, 2 liters of water, holes in my shoe, change in headband, backpack tan, sunglass tan, burnt arms, sore legs, and dirt all over my body was the result of my trip at Turtlehead Peak.Making it to the top of Turtlehead Peak I was rewarded with a really nice cool breeze, an ammo box holding a signature book, and one of the best views I have ever seen in my life. Worth it? Yes. Would I do it again? Probably not. 

Would not recommend for something looking for a nice stroll in nature or a quick hike (less than 4 hours). 

What I learned from my experience and mistakes is that you should have the following items with you:

1. Excess water (better to have more than less in this case)
2. Sunblock
3. Hiking shoes or comfortable shoes that you don't mind destroying.
4. FOOD! ( I really lacked on this one, I ate prior to the hike, but all that uphill really took a toll on my energy. I appreciate the kindness of whoever left a Clifbar inside the ammo box holding the signature book. Don't think I would of made it down without one)
5. A companion
6. A map or GPS device.
7. Focus
8. Patience

P.S. Don't get off the trail like my group did within the first 15 minutes. There are trail markers for you that will make the trip a lot less strenuous and more enjoyable.

My meal always starts out with an egg roll. These are no ordinary egg rolls...they're not tiny, and aren't considered one of those side items tossed in as an afterthought as at most Chinese restaurants. No - these egg rolls could be a meal! Filled with baby shrimp, cabbage, and carrots, the filling is tender with a bit of a crunch. The wrapper isn't your typical thin, fried, ""papery skin"". The wrapper is a bit more substantial because of the size of the egg roll..yet it's crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. The best egg rolls I've ever eaten.

I also like to order the fried pork dumplings. They're pretty basic as pork dumplings go, but they have a great flavor and the dipping sauce is very good. I'm pretty picky about my dumpling sauce. I don't like it too salty or too sweet. This is just perfect with a touch of heat.

My main course staple is the chicken with garlic sauce. This is noted on the menu as a spicy item. The Thai red pepper flakes give it the right amount of heat without overpowering the garlic brown sauce. It's a simple dish with slivers of white meat chicken, slivered water chestnuts, and a few mushrooms tossed in for good measure. This dish is so flavorful that you don't need anything else. I love the chicken paired with the crunch of the water chestnuts. They both take on the flavor of the sauce quite well. 

Other great dishes are the chicken lo mein, General Tso's Chicken, and chicken with broccoli.

Basically I curated this woman's art, sacred objects and artifacts collection and needless to say it was a very memorable week working in what you can imagine to be a very eclectic home.  When the job finished my client invited the crew and I to a celebration dinner which brought us to a restaurant in Inglewood on 9th avenue S.E. called Sugo Caffe Italia.

Just sitting outside Sugo I felt underdressed and so did my co-workers but our appetites and curiosity managed to find our way into the restaurant where our reservation of 6 was warmly greeted by the staff.  The decor in this restaurant is exquisite, simple and clean with accents of contemporary earthy art pieces on warm muted walls.  Jarred tomatoes and jams are illuminated upwards with mini lights shining brightly from beneath them and antique chandeliers hang above dripping with crystal raindrops and lined pearl beads.  There is no corner that has not been thought out decoration wise here and the table settings are complete with artisan ceramics and fine crystal glassware.

An average meal is between 20 to 40 dollars but once you savour the many dishes on a menu that changes every evening and the many cheese options that I couldn't pronounce you are completely titillated.  Every meal's presentation has been evoked with an artist's touch and the freshest ingredients are presented in front of you to tantalize your palate.  I was extremely impressed by an ample Scotch list, over 15 choices and the huge portions of deserts that were presented in the most elegant formations that look like one could almost wear them as head pieces.

I was so impressed by Sugo the first time that I took my partner there to have our own celebration dinner the very next evening.

The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).  And that's where the good stuff stops.
In short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).  This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables.
The full story.
Upon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.  Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.
After waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.
Quite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.
The water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.
The appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.
Eventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.
Within 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.
The burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.
The waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her ""no"", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.
My husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.
So. 
The steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). 
We never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.  
I DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables......",11.0,6X0i-oGUbh5DZdTHzFuKfg

Looked at our checking account on Tuesday. Found out that they had debited our account for the rental plus the initial deposit.

A relatively new member of the staff is Tony, who recently left Saigon 8.  The guy is terrific, and I've seen him iron out the bumps when language is a problem.  He's the reason I came to this restaurant in the first place.

I've had pho twice and vermicelli with grilled pork, spicy (#68) once.  The pho broth was pretty good (not quite Saigon 8, but not bad), and the meat, etc., was also good.  The #68 was the best thing I've had there, and it is served in a bowl rather than a plate, which I think helped.  The restaurant was jam packed (Friday, about 1:30 p.m.), but service went smoothly.  By the time I was finished, I would say about two thirds of the crowd had left after eating.

At the table, There was hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot sauce, plus fish sauce and soy sauce.  There was also a jar of a pepper sauce that looked like a Szechuan sauce, but didn't have the heat.  There were plain wooden chop sticks, which I like, spoons, and small saucers, which I use to mix a dip.  I've mentioned in my Jenny Pho review that this is the way I prefer it, instead of bringing stuff out with the pho, and using lacquered chop sticks.

One thing you should know is that there is a sign that says cash only.  That changed a couple of months ago.  They allow major credit cards (Visa, MC), but they left the sign up.

I like the restaurant for the quality of the food, which is pretty good, location, near I-15, and the fact that Tony now works here, and he's terrific.

Something I should have said earlier:  Pho Little Saigon makes its own Vietnamese sandwiches.  I brought some home, and they're very good.  Pho Saigon 8 doesn't  make its own, though there's a shop that makes them out the rear of their parking lot.",0.0,guP0iaS6scB_ONYC67fyYw

Even if you have simple tastes Joes Farm Grill will have something to suit your needs.  It has beautiful decoration, great food and affordable prices, so why not pay a visit. 
Joes Farm Grill has a long historical background, with a house originally built in 1966 by the Johnston family. In later years it was decided to turn the farm into a restaurant with its food being home grown or locally brought in. The house development around the farm is Agritopia, and was dedicated to permanent urban farming. In fact if you live in the development surrounding the restaurant you can rent a garden lot to grow vegetables.  All of their products are certified USDA organic, and their focus is common food done uncommonly. They feel fresh food taste better and are better for you so why not share all that with the customers. They take the foods taste to a new level with all of the recipes and ingredients. 
Joes Farm Grill is delicious, unique and a fun experience. I feel most restaurants are chains and don't have the history behind them like Joes does, and because of this it makes the experience much more special. Knowing your food is organic makes it taste ten times better, and knowing you don't have to spend a fortune for organic makes me want to go again. It's really stands out among most and everyone in the chandler area needs to stop by and visit. 
 First walking up to the twelve acre masterpiece is like going through a farm, with orange trees covering the path and large oaks surrounding it which gives a beautiful green glow of a garden.  It smells fresh and gives you an earthy vive. They are enormous and full of green vegetables that look extremely appetizing. They are covering most of the land and you can walk through them and see your food growing.  The building is white with large windows showing the back and the front equally, and the inside has simple decorations with light blue and green accents not to overpower the beauty of the vegetation growing outside. It holds no more than a hundred people and is rather spacious seating. The entire restaurant is very simple with a 60s feel mixed with a futuristic time. I ordered the jumbo breaded shrimp with fries, French toast banana peanut butter sandwich and the barbeque chicken pizza. I went with my sister because the portions are rather large and I could not have eaten it by myself. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and my sisters second. Everything so far was very pleasant and the employees were very nice. No more than ten minutes later our food was ready and it looked and smelt great. We sat down and I tried each dish, starting with the shrimp which were very large. The shrimp was crunchy and juicy and was simple and not overpowering. I thought it tasted very good and wasn't too rich which is a problem I normally find when ordering shrimp. Then I tried the French toast peanut butter sandwiches that surprisingly had strawberry's in it too. This was one of the best tasting things I have ever had! It was a house specialty and lives up to its name. It tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet. I had to order another one. Then I tried the barbeque pizza, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. It was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination. It just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it. The prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14.99 when I go again I probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish.  The peanut butter sandwiches were 10.99 and I crave these every day it was amazing! Than last the pizza was 12.99, my sister liked it more than I did so it depends on your taste but I probably will try something else. 
The most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular. Fresh fries galore. The most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place. I think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself. I didn't expect that and I think it's a smart move on the restaurants part.  The calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice. 
I enjoyed Joes Farm Grill and I plan on visiting again. I think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society. I feel better knowing I'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic. I hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same.

Oyster lovers love the oysters here!  they are on the happy hour menu in the bar area.  Yellowtail sashimi is OMG to die for.  Heirloom tomato salad was fantastic too.  Filet always a good choice... The asparagus was cooked to perfection and I would choose the augratin potatoes over the twice baked.  Ive had both and I prefer mashed or baked usually but these augratin are wow... really great.  The Sole is super!  It is a HUGE portion so unless you are a big eater or you are sharing... there is too much to eat but its prepared to a T!  It has a crispy exterior due to the parmasan crusting... and its delish!

True confession, I had a little fall in Old Scottsdale the day before on unsteady footwear so my foot was twisted and painful.  The lady worked my feet perfectly, although a bit painfully.  But good.  I walk a ton and have calluses on the pads of my feet that really needed attention.  My feet are in much better shape now - pretty!

A bonus for us was the owner, who was a big football fan and confessed he'd bet on the Vikings to win the Super Bowl.  Then we talked Packers - the local team that has our hearts!

Cue Club is large inside and out. Like how can they use this much space? The bartender gave us the lowdown as soon as we walked in: the building is divided into smoking and non smoking and each have either quarter tables or pay by the hour tables. Apparently you can only do pay by the hour if you're a pro. We chose the non smoking side and there were 2-3 other tables being used at the time. The jukebox was surprisingly really good until someone chose to play their own tunes. We did end up smelling like cigarette smoke afterwards. Not sure if this is from hanging out in the smoking area initially or if it's so overpowering that it gets into the non smoking area. They also have shuffleboard and a few carnival style games like skee ball. Knowing that most any billiards hall in Vegas is going to be equally smoky I think I'd rather come here and know your chances of getting a table are pretty good and they're at least attempting to offer a non smoking option.,0.0,rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA

However, it paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  The prices are obscene first of all - about double what I've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  Not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at Guy Savoy we had tackled two nights prior was MUCH more affordable and more enjoyable.

Our standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  Good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  The next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  The truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  I absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  The foie gras was excellent however.  

The main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  The quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time I've had authentic prime wagyu before where I was charged far less for the pleasure. 

 The one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  The presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  The dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  The free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    Service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.  

Overall, Robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  I feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  At half the price, I'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but I felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I don't feel there's any reason to visit Robuchon.  And I say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris, which was exceptional all around.  If you do go to Robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which I didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable.",2.0,th5TCwgIUvK9UX9XLa4VGw

Luckily we didn't. It is a very small place, but very warm and cozy and romantic as well. We had exceptional service the entire night and great sushi dishes! We went off the recommendations of our waitress and loved everything.

The kids started with the junior carts and that was the right call as neither really had much experience driving carts (Mario Kart doesn't count) so they were a bit cautious at first. However, in their second race they put the pedal to the metal and tested the limits of their speed-limited carts.

The adults took the big carts for a run and I was lucky to be racing with novices and took the checkered flag in one of the two races. I was foiled by a ""pile up"" in one of the races which killed my lap average. :) My lovely wife took a nice stroll around the course and it was fun to wave as I zipped by.

The service was excellent. The track-workers were hilarious. All in all a great experience. 

** note ** Our first attempt to race was marred by the company Groupon and their multi-hour outage in March 2015. We did not print the groupon, we couldn't pull it up on our phones, and they had no way to help us over the phone (30+ min wait to tell us that).

Dingy concourses, drab and downright depressing. I always feel badly for those with mobility limitations trying to get to the end of the c concourse. People movers would be great but clearly the walkways aren't wide enough.

I did enjoy the built-in TV in the mirror in the bathroom. My BF thought I fell in the toilet because I was taking so damn long but I just had to reassure him that I was just watching TV LOL! And I didn't mind the pink florenscent lighting in the bathroom. Pink is my favorite color!

Sure the casino floor can be smoky but I really didn't care because as a smoker, I was contributing to the smokiness.

And boo to the cocktail waitress that wouldn't give my BF 2 drinks because she was insinuating that one was for me and I wasn't playing at the time. Um, missy can't you see that I have 2 drinks already that are keeping me rather busy?

Each time the service has been fantastic. 

For lunch both times I got the Green Chili Cheeseburger, which comes with some awesome spicy French fries. The sandwich has cheese, delicious green chili and picked onions. It's awesome and that's why I got it both times.

I have received sports massages, Swedish and deep tissue. I consider La Vida to be a very good facility and Angel to be a very competent therapist. For more than 6 months I have gone once every 3-4 weeks.

I work out regularly and consider a massage a great way to heal sore muscles and low back pain from sitting at a desk all day. After my old therapist moved to Florida, I began the annoying process of trying new ones. Some have trouble dialing up or down the pressure. Some can't get the low back pain out like others. Some reek of cigarette smoke. Some are lazy, using one hand at a time instead of two.

Then I found Angel, who is quite competent. If you wanna chat, she'll chat. If you want quiet relaxation, she'll put you at ease. If you say ""I hurt here"", she will solve it. I consider one of Angel's attributes to be the fact she can dial up or down pressure just BARELY, and maintain that. She can find where it hurts and, due to her through knowledge of fascia and layers of tissue, massage the pain away. After repeat sessions, she understands I need more pressure on the right side of my spine than my left. Angel's ability to meet her clients needs combined with her through knowledge of muscle and fascia along with the ability to maintain consistent pressure make her an extremely competent therapist.

If Angel is busy or sick, Ivan is a fantastic alternative. He's an A in my book, with Angel an A+. Edit: Forgot to mention, Ivan's strengths are deep tissue and neck work. If your neck specifically is killing you or you need real deep tissue, Ivan is your man.

La Vida is an upper middle / yuppie chain massage location with ample parking. I feel strongly that these are superior to middle brow chain massage places (such as Massage Envy) and superior to upscale spas (such as Sewickly or Seven Springs or Esspa). Simply put, La Vida has lots of returning clients and as such, a steady stream of business and competent and calm massage therapists with little turnover.",9.0,VKrXZY_OjTZ1yg7a3HH_4w

Anyway, thank you to the GM for being such a jerk; this allowed for me to see that there is no flexibility whenever there is an issue that may arise with your patrons. The reason I signed with 24?

Thus, we actually PREFER a hotel with no casino in it. I got a Travelzoo rate several months ago for $109/nt for a King Suite with a view.

When we arrived, check-in was VERY efficient and speedy. Our room was on the 55th floor and we had a view straight down the Strip. The room was spacious and had a well-equipped kitchenette (including Sub Zero mini fridge, Bosch microwave and Cuisinart toaster and blender). The bathroom had a huge marble shower and separate Jacuzzi bathtub, double marble sinks and a flatscreen TV INSIDE of the mirror! The furnishings are very clean and modern and the room felt luxurious.

The best part of the entire room was the bed! It was easily the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in -- IN MY LIFE! The front desk told me they are made by Stearns & Foster specially for Mr. Trump, but that he thinks something similar is available through the company. The sheets were high TC and the pillows and comforter were lofty and plump. The hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before.

My complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free WiFi ($12/day is a little steep and I felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo/conditioner wasn't very high quality. Boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet. My only other comment is that the lobby is a little bit gauche (but, it's Vegas...what lobby isn't?!).

All in all, I thought this was a FANTASTIC value and, as I said, the best bed I've experienced in my life. I will definitely be back.

p.s. in response to those who say it's ""off the Strip,"" it's not. It's on the older part of the Strip (near Circus Circus), but it's not technically ""off-Strip.""  Also, when it's 110 degrees outside, I don't know who is actually WALKING from casino to casino, anyway!!! Seriously? Doesn't everyone take a cab everywhere?",0.0,vhn1kAld_SYmerdUNHyKQg

 Staff are great (see exception below).   Most staff here were fabulous.  The check in was smooth, the valet staff are lovely, one of the cleaning staff even offered to wait for me to get my Starbucks when she saw me hesitating to leave the guest access only area because I forgot my card. 

The amenities here are awesome!  The pools are gorgeous and one pool has a sand bottom portion with a sand beach.   

The only thing I will say needs to change is the pool staff.   For the most part the wait staff was okay but could definitely improve but what I found awful were the lifeguards.   The first day we were at the pool three lifeguards just talked amongst themselves and bottle flipped to keep themselves busy. Yes, bottle flipped - my 8 year kids favorite game.  There was even a point where a young child in the pool went face down in the water and the adult with them didn't notice and guess what? Neither did the lifeguards.   No kidding someone is going to die on their watch if they continue like this.  The second day here it was two lifeguards having a bromance looking at each other the whole time instead of at the pool.  I get that it's not that busy but it's a job that has some dangerous consequences if you aren't doing your job even for a moment.  Instead they were passing a life float between them for fun, talking about picking girls up at the bar to the point my husband had to leave becauae he didn't want to here their childish talk anymore.

So its put in this cardboard box, then the red and white checkorboard paper is put in, then the rice, beans, cabbage, etc.  The problem with this is the paper is not designed to be under juicy foods like beans, so by the time I got down to the bottom the paper was disintegrating into my food.

It was in a pretty dingy strip mall but we weren't deterred. There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). 

We started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. 

Then, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned. 

For entrees I got a shredded beef taco and my dad got a combo plate with an enchilada, rice and beans. Pretty bad - bland and nothing to come back for. 

The 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you're wanting Mexican food, you'd be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel's.

I really love this path.  I like going out into wilderness more than strolling through the city's center, but THERE'S SHADE ON THIS TRAIL !!!   Yea!
If you were to go all heat stroke it wouldn't take a helicopter to extract you!   Yea!
Lots of friendly people of various hobbies and fitness levels, and a Boy Scout troop (I cannot recall the name of to give credit to) has even continued to supply the doggie mitt boxes with real pick-up bags, even though the city of Phoenix has stopped supplying them to all of the dog parks.
At the north end of the path, you are a little south of Dunlap ave, near Corbin's and Bombero's, and at a crossroads with the Trail going along the Canal.  You can park in the lot at Senior Villa Mexican Restaurant [*Edit: Formerly this mexican rest, but now the new Central Grille at 8525 N Central*].  If you want to start further south, then there are plenty of churches where you can prob park, but this restaurant is not open in the early part of the day, so even on weekends, this is a nice place to park.  
Lock up!  Despite your surroundings, and those even more posh further to the south, you are only a 5 minute walk from downtown Sunnyslope. 
On the southwest side of the canal, there's a house with it's back wall bordering the canal path.  The folks here have built a few Guard Towers for their little dog, and s/he gets to runs up the steps to see over the wall and bark at whomever is going by.  NEAT and FUN for that dog, but was a little distracting to my dogs, who wanted to eat that yappy little....)
Only trouble I had: 
once you're down the road a bit further south on Central, you are moving past various houses, estates, and condominiums, and are no longer near any of those restaurants up near Dunlap, however there is a distinct odor of DIRTY SPENT FRYER GREASE all up and down the path.  I wonder if the city sprays a petroleum product on the unpaved path to keep dust down?  I hope not; they did that on my street as a kid in Detroit, and anyone who walked on it barefoot got blisters, cracking, and peeling skin.  Blech!  Even if I lived near here, I'd rather have the dust, and I don't want that on my dogs feet, either. One reason I'd use this path in the summer is that with all the nice sized shade trees, you don't need to get your dog booties.

TWICE!  A great place for beer geeks!  They have their entire line-up of current beers to choose from and an excellent little store that you can purchase bombers and interesting things like Trois Pistoles Mustard, Blance De Chambly Orange Marmalade, and Trois Pistoles Blackberry Jam (we purchased all three of these and they are all delicious)!

We hit the restaurant at a weird time (around 4pm) on this trip and they had a limited menu.  We did a meat and cheese plate to go along with a Sampler (3 ounces of Blanche De Chambly, Ephemere [Seasonal], Blonde De Chambly, Noire De Chambly, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles) and Seigneuriale for me and an Ephemere Cerise (Cherry) for my wife.  A minor setback was that four of the six beers in my sampler came out of the bottle instead of the tap, so only two of them had that super-fresh taste, but it was still good nonetheless.  I would recommend finding out what is on draft and sticking with those, though, because those beers will rank among the best beers you will ever have in your life.

Restaurant atmosphere was beautiful.  When we went during the summer, it felt like a lovely cottage house on the lake.  When it was cold in October, it felt like a rustic ski lodge just getting ready for the snow.  Service was very courteous.  We practiced our French this time (as there were some language barriers on the first visit) but both of our servers spoke excellent English.

Definitely recommended to swing through on your way up to Montreal.  Even if you're heading to Quebec City, it's not difficult to get to, just a long trip after you leave.  If you're heading back to the US, just remember that you'll be dealing with the border about a half-hour after leaving and that might not work out too well.  Please note that we were able to purchase Unibroue shirts on our first trip through but we heard a rumor that no more clothes were being produced.  I hope they change their mind on that one!

When I came in, the lobby seemed pretty busy (they were getting low on seating, but not out) and I took a number. I was seen less than 30 minutes later, and never felt like my wait was too long.

When I was taken back, there are tables set up, where the vets and vet techs come talk with you and help your pet. You're not in a separate room (like my old vet). This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think for one of my dogs it was better because while he got blood drawn and a vaccine, he was too distracted to care - there was (what looked like a) lab/pit mix across the room who may have at one point looked at him! How interesting! and that golden over there! What's that smell behind me?

Everyone that works there is friendly, and they work quickly. Since they work rather quickly, don't expect to sit down and have a long conversation. They get to the point, and then send you on your way because there are twenty more dogs to be seen. I never felt rushed though.

If you own pets, you know that they can be expensive. Even small expenses add up quickly. I ended up at Gateway because I priced out my annual vet trip at my old vet and cringed. A lot. I called around and checked out a few other places. I felt like Goldilocks. One vet was a little cheaper, but the staff seemed to hate their jobs and maybe me. Another vet was more expensive but seemed nice. Gateway? Gateway was just right. Gateway didn't offer me any discount, yet I felt like I got two for the price of one (I paid what I would have for just one dog at my old place). My dogs got their vaccines for the next year plus(heartworm and rabies), as well as kennel cough, and one of my dogs got microchipped. Previously I was told that the kennel cough vaccine is given every other year as a shot, and every other nasal - but Gateway had oral. That was so much easier on both of my dogs! One of my dogs is a pug, so the nasal was unpleasant for him and I (on the plus side, last year I got the vaccine as well - since he sprayed it all over me). 

Both of my dogs seemed well cared for while I was there, and got plenty of love. The microchipped dog seemed neutral (and wouldn't take any treats from the vet tech after she took him to get microchipped), but he pug LOVED it. I practically had to drag him out of there.

I have spent over 1000 dollars and still not finished from 6+k in damages from the estimate on my car that I left there on a Wednesday afternoon and Geico estimated 15 days to repair it and then was told it was done the next Tues.morning. Corners cut? Anyone with half of a brain would agree. I asked where's my new rim damaged in the accident? Oh sorry here is another Geico adjuster present standing next to my car. Owner says my adjuster Tom Fletcher is an asshole and that the guy present standing next to my car was fair and he said he would get me a rim. And the owner also promised the rim regardless and when I asked how much more to do some touch up paint work he said FREE! Long as I would bring my business to them, from now on. 
     He surely noticed that my inspection was up soon as he promised me BOTH! Then I NEVER heard another word from them again since Dec.2016. And still have not been able to afford to fix all of the damage done in the accident that they overlooked due to quick in and out. I had to buy a new battery 3 days later when my car wouldn't start. Whatever mechanic worked on my car forgot to plug in the power cord to my new radiator cooling fan and my car overheated and had to spend money to get a diagnosis why it was overheating and was a simple wire not plugged in. So also proof it was never even tested to see if the new fan worked . This was a front end collision and then I had and still have a loud clicking sound coming from my front wheel where the rim wasn't replaced.  When I took it elsewhere for inspection soon after due to no reply from multiple messages left for the owner gone without a reply? Rather than bother with them after speaking with an ex-employee, I realized I was screwed.  So then I had a broken tie rod not noticed or added to my estimate and anyone knows you need an alignment when you replace a tie rod so another 300 bucks total. 
    But still have the clicking noise or loud tapping and my friend said it's either The CV joint or a bent control arm. But couldn't tell without it on a lift . So now will end up spending a fortune to finally get my car back to perfect operating condition like it was before one of their tow truck drivers just happened to be standing there in downtown Pittsburgh during rush hour with a walkie.  Waiting to prey on me. But I still haven't gotten to the most corrupt part.  Geico paid them from my estimate to recharge my A.C. since it was obvious that it was routine when my radiator, cooling fan, and coolant tank were all destroyed.

They said well I can't imagine they would have not recharged your system with refrigerant.  So I paid for a diagnosis and dye ran thru the system and nice of them to only charge me 75 bucks and guess what? Cold air!!! NO LEAKS! SO THEY NEVER EVEN RECHARGED MY A.C. Crooks!

On a weekday at 12:00 they were completely empty and it's a huge restaurant so that's a little bit of a concern right off the bat.  I had the cheese enchiladas which were ok, not anything special and kinda plain.  The Corn pudding for a side was something you never see and was the best thing on my plate.  The Anaheim Chili stuffed with sweet potato would be better if they removed the skin. It was pretty inedible the way it was served and very messy to scrape the pepper and potato off the skin to eat it.

I've been to the one in Thousand Oaks, CA a few times and thought I would give this location a try. It is located in the Crystals shopping plaza that is next to the Aria hotel. This place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your Sunday best. 

I made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a Saturday night. We had a nice table an attentive waiter. We got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  There was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it. 

I still went with the meat selection even though this was the Ocean Club. My boyfriend and I both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. The meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. The steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, I call it Meaty Symphonic Harmony. 

We also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side. This is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. Each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. I was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies). 

Dessert is something that just can't be missed and I suggest the sinful delight of the signature Warm Butter Cake and whipped cream. The butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. It almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate.

They can substitute a whole wheat bun but this time, I didn't ask whether they were vegan. It tasted fine, the toppings were generous and the veg burger was cooked well. The only thing that I would change next time is that I ask for the bun to be warmed or toasted. It was a barely room temperature and it detracted from my overall enjoyment of the burger.

Even though the service and food here were both below average, the worst has nothing to do with their bad food/service, but business ethics (the thing that keeps businesses from cheating their customers).
This restaurant, my dear reader, has violated the key principle of doing business - they are cheaters:
They put a couple of sales promotions on yelp to lure you in and spend money, but when it is time to pay, the servers stare at the yelp page i hold in my hand and have the guts to say: ""sorry, we can not honor that...""
Naturally, I asked: ""why not? You put it on your yelp page, so i think you should honor it.""
This is the restaurant's response: ""sorry, but we haven't done that for a while now.""
""Not for anybody?""
""Yeah...not for anybody.""

Back in the day if you had a failed attempt in one arm followed immediately by a failed stick in the other, they'd apologize and send you on your way with a bandage on both arms and no donation.  No need to be upset about it.  It happens.  It is simply fortunate that I can donate.  Many can't but I cant see getting upset about it.  For whatever reason it just wasn't time NH.  Whether it was something in the questionaire or who knows. 

 I have yet, in all the time I have been going there ever felt unwelcomed or unwanted there.  Sorry you prepared so heavily and feel let down.  I can say the staff are all wonderful.  They are like a whole different family and the time spent in the chair is comfortable and safe!  I can honestly say I am defensive of them because I have spent many many hours in the chair.  Ms.Betty at the desk is definitely in her element!  Everyone there is upbeat and no one is ever grouchy!  Vinny is magic with a needle for those of you who worry about that.

We got there just before the lunch rush and scored a prime table near the windows (tho upon leaving, my friend noted how cozy the sofa-bench tables looked, so I'll aim for one of those next time). Our server, Robert, made even the soup of the day (tomato bisque) sound out of this world. Even after the restaurant filled up, he was attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal. 

We shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalapeño sauce. They could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. And for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: I had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me. 

The decor was comforting in a British pub style. I wish the menu had been more unique (burgers, BLT, variety of salads), esp for a place with the wird ""arrogant"" staring at you.

It's not a one-stop, get all your groceries for the week kind of place, but it works marvelously as a neighborhood market with a few necessities and a great variety of delicious fruits, vegetables, olives, pasta and frozen meat.

Goddamn am I glad this place opened.  Prior to this, my closest convenient neighborhood market was Rollin's Market with its rotting bell peppers and frozen Banquet dinners.  There's always Fry's or Safeway, but I like hitting up a small little market on the corner of my neighborhood and build a rapport with the employees and owners as part of establishing a community.

The dude who runs the place will sometimes thrown in a tomato or apple or lime in with your bag of groceries.  Hey, free apple.  

Not everything they have is permanent.  Sometimes something new will be there, and the next week it will be gone, but in a way, I like that about it.  You go in there, and they have these Indian pickles made from wild cucumbers.  Next week, in its place, will be garlic pickles or something else awesome.

For what the place is, it's marvelous.  It's a little place and about as un-ghetto as it gets.  It's nice having a little market where you can pop in and buy polish sausage from a local farmer, organic soup, goat cheese with kalamata olives but you can also get your regular ass Skippy peanut butter and Campbell's soup.",3.0,2uZ8uULKN38ZiM-Iakr5TA

Just had an -interesting- conversation with the girl who answers the phone, Amanda. 
WOW.
After being asking what I was calling for (catering an event, duh!) I told her what I needed, I was put on hold, phone was answered again by Amanda who acted like she hadn't just talked to me 6 seconds before and asked the same question again. 

Her absolutely lack of professionalism quickly wore down my patience. I felt like I was dealing with a 15 year old!!

In the middle of asking me what our date was for our wedding, venue, etc., she blurts out ""Oh, you know there is a 5k minimum for December. You know that, right?"" 
I was baffled by the way she said this, as well as there was no surrounding explanation or context... When I asked ""Why?"" She laughed at me and then said ""Well, thats just our policy."" Okay, that's fine. There are much, MUCH better ways of presenting this to a prospective client. Also, you probably shouldn't say it to someone when you don't know what their budget is or how much they are willing to pay. Moreover, the condescending, rude tone in which you say things like that have a lasting effect. 

They don't know that they are on the preferred vendor's list at my venue, they don't know specific rules or things that the venue already provides and this girl seems to have no grasp of how to get details from someone without asking the most idiotic questions. If someone keeps saying ""We just require a plated dinner, no other services from you."" You don't need to keep asking things like ""what about cake, what about a bartender, what about hors D'oeuvres?"" ""NO! Just a plated dinner."" 

Total incompetence, lack of professionalism, rude, and absolutely not a business who I would recommend working with after this brief and exhausting exchange. 

I wanted to book a simple consultation to try to talk to a coherent adult about food, do a tasting, and then sign a contract --TO GIVE YOU MONEY--! 

To the owner of this business: 
(Before I completely wrote you off as my potential caterer) I requested that when I got my call back, I would like to deal directly with the owner, Jennifer. 
Amanda rudely asked ""Why?!?"" I told her that I would like to deal with someone who knows the venue that I am booked at, (considering you are a preferred vendor there). 
I would strongly suggest getting someone else who knows how to deal with customers, has a better ""table-side manner"", and knowledge of halfway decent customer service.

Heck yeah I'll take it! Ordering through a phone call or going in would be better. Put my order and a couple co workers order in online and paid. 25 bucks gone. Another co worker left to get the food and went to the counter to pick up order. Luckily he made it just as it started filling up with people. The employee at the counter didn't have any idea what he was talking about when he said he was there for an online order pickup. Luckily I printed out my ""invoice"" as they call it and sent it with him. Had it not been for him having that paper they wouldn't have taken the order. I get it, sometimes technology doesn't work right and you get missed. They realized and said sorry and made the order quickly.

Overall: Food had some good points, but I wasn't overwhelmed.  West Covina, CA location is better if you're in the area.

Hainan chicken - chicken was soft, but they left out the best part - the chicken juice.  I love it when they pour that stuff all over the rice.  (I say juice so it sounds healthier than say, 'oily chicken essence.'  Also, if you want really good Hainan chicken rice and you happen to be in Alhambra, CA, go here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/savoy-kitchen-alhambra#hrid:8nuOzJJQDsKa9NK-WhJsbQ/src:search/query:hainan%20chicken)  

Some sort of egg tofu - pretty good, but really heavy.  Don't order it unless you're hungry or you really know how to scarf protein.  

Roti canai - Must try for Malaysian cuisine it seems.  Crepe/pancake style bread that you dip in curry.  The curry was good, don't remember what kind it was.  I don't think it was served hot enough, though.  It got cold too quickly.  My mom said the bread wasn't as good as their location West Covina.  

Chicken satay - Really light appetizer.   They give you really small, thin strips of chicken.  Don't expect this to be in any way filling (unless you decide to pour the peanut sauce all over your rice, and you just might be because that sauce is so sweet and delicious.  Almost sweet enough to be a dessert.)",0.0,8vIK6ndl8yzIdmSDnGp0tw

Went here with a group from work for an ""appreciation dinner""  Normally, Appreciation dinners end up at Chili's or Ruby Tuesday so I was completely shocked we ended up here.

Everything was great service wise.  Foodwise, it was good but I'd expect that from a place like this.  I ordered one of their Mixup lunches which gives you a salad option, a protein and a side.  I ordered the mixed green salad, the porcini mushroom and pepper encrusted strip and an order of carmelized cauliflower as a side.

The strip was amazing.  It came sliced over a layer of steak sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The salad was ok....mixed greens with tomatoes, blue cheese and a dressing that I still do not recognize.  The cauliflower came in a mound.  Honestly, this had to be 1/2 to 2/3 of the head of cauliflower.  It was seasoned with capers and other herbs.  While the taste was good, the quantity was entirely too much and I could only eat half.

The decor of the place is as you would expect with a lot of medium to dark wood but it just didn't do anything for me.  Same with the service. While they were all friendly, our water just didn't go beyond what he was expect to do.

Gah... I wish I could remember my tech's name 'cause she was just as nice and courteous - just remember it starting with a D. She let me fully explain my iPhone problem, then she walked me through diagnosing with their speakers. She literally could tell that the difference I had with it compared to hers. Before trying to replace my phone, she wanted to know if I had any questions for her and I brought up how I bought the device from my cell provider. Not wanting to cause any problems with them, she wrote me a notice to bring to them just in case they wanted proof that the device needed to be replaced. All courteous and thoughtful. 
Other than my experience, I can commend them on trying to accommodate/help a mom and her 2 kids. The little brother overheard the patron say she had the wrong appointment time, but she had been waiting for awhile and had other appointments elsewhere. Before they could get to me, they helped her out first. Her tech was nice, trying to be personable with her and the kids while diagnosing the problem.

Well, here it is ya jerk!!
Artistic Armory combines everything you like about an underground music club with elements of an actual, organic independent art scene. It is the opposite of First Friday, a refreshing alternative to seeing bands in filthy bars, and the antithesis of hanging out at the mall.

I used the bathroom... once...

The bar tenders are great!! There's a tall dude with strong hands and a pretty girl who likes to talk about different ways to cook chicken (women love chicken).

Check out their Facebook page for a listing of upcoming events.
The website is maintained by some dude named Gus (I guess he is an employee and/or web designer), and contains about as much useful information as one of those hooker trading cards you get on the strip. 

The Artistic Armory a roof, which is great and really compliments the floor, which I once cleaned up baby carrots off of. 

My only complaint is that some drunk with tattoos and a beard kept banging into me and spilling my drink. I attempted to complain to management, but a tattooed guy with a beard said that my vague description was not going to help him narrow down the assailant. 

Overall, your experience will be based on what you make of your time at The Artistic Armory. Just don't talk to anyone in a black t-shit with a band name printed on it and you should be fine.

It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation.

However, when the bartender at the awesome strip mall wine bar told me about this place you could get buggalo of food for less than a five spot, I was sold.  

Cook Out is an anomaly among fast food places in that its menu has everything you could ever want, or at least everything I could ever want (sans corn nuggets).  Cook Out offers the boring old hamburger thing but don't let that distract you- opt for the BBQ.  For less than $5, you get your own picnic.  

My plate had a hockey puck sized portion of pulled pork, a couple fingers of hush puppies, fries, and slaw. The chronic pulled pork was super moist considering it was 1 AM, and came topped with Texas Pete's.  Although it was delicious, isn't Carolina BBQ supposed to be heavy on the sauce?  The hush puppies were okay (more breading than bread), and the fries forgettable.  When it comes to cole slaw, I am a snob but Cook Out's slaw was surprisingly good; it was house made and very dry, but I mean that in a good way.   It's also worth mentioning that you can get a corn dog as a side.  I don't know why, but as a Southern gentleman, I agree with and salute that.  

How Cook Out really let me get my jollies was the drink menu.  Cheerwine- my god, if I ever make a lot of money I'm putting a fountain of that crack drank in my house.  If you're from out of town, drink up because that stuff can only be found in North Carolina.  They also have about 40 different kinds of milkshakes available, including seasonal ones.  The winter shake is eggnog but apparently they only have that one in December.  The fact that they have a watermelon shake in the summer blows my mind.  Be warned though, the shakes are thick like a Petey Pablo video girl- you'll need a spoon, or at least a boba tea straw.  

As I said, the idea of a fast food BBQ joint just doesn't do it for me, but Cook Out pulls together the concept beautifully.  It's like if Jesus and Allah got along and then made a baby.  A beautiful mixed baby named Cook Out.",3.0,N8M1Dmks-FtPCLiaVSy73g

The atmosphere was busy but not frantic.  The decor was fun and playful, making you feel very comfortable.

The guacamole was outstanding (we ate the entire thing) along with their tortilla soup and salsa verde.  The shrimp enchiladas were enjoyed on my second visit, those too were phenomenal.  Their food has a balance of spice and flavor without being overly salty.  Their tequila selection is killer.  If you enjoy good tequila this is your spot, they have just about everything you want and a few you may not have heard of yet.  

You have to be sure to get a picture on the swing next to the bar.  It's a fun photo op and a great way to remember the place.  La Comida makes a great first date spot, especially if you want to see how your date holds their alcohol.  It's also fun with a group of people, their bench seating easily accommodates large parties.

What I wasn't prepared for was run down and dirty. First of all, it's very easy to miss this place, we drove by it twice as it's wedged in between two other businesses and there is not a single hotel person (i.e. valet) waiting outside. We ended up having to call the front desk and ask where we were supposed to park the car to unload our bags. She seemed confused by this request and after a few minutes she told us just to leave the car in the service entrance behind the hotel. Weird! What hotel doesn't have some sort of established valet system for their guests arriving in cars. 

Check in was fine and the staff was nice but I knew as I walked in this wasn't going to work out. The lobby was super small. It was cramped with four people waiting at the front desk. We were told we had been upgraded to a junior suite, so I was hopeful the room at least would be nice. The elevator was dark and dingy and barely fit two people with luggage. 

As soon as we got to the room, the few hopes I had left were dashed. The room size was nice but it was just....dingy. The bed was lumpy, everything from the curtains to the dust ruffle were wrinkled and stained. The linoleum was cracked, the burner carpet looked like it had been there for roughly a hundred years.

We've dined here several times, and on Sunday, not surprisingly, we were the only non-Asian customers in the place. The chef was in rare form, and as I sit here having my third round of leftovers for lunch I'm still loving my dish. I opted for the Vinegar Fish, it's pretty simple -- whitefish, wood ear mushrooms and water chestnuts prepared with a dose of spice and rice wine vinegar. I'm guessing by the waitress' excitement when I ordered, that it's a dish they're pretty proud of. It was fabulous.

Hubby ordered the Beef and Onions, which I would classify as good, but not mind-blowing. We also partook of the Gai-choy which was cooked perfectly -- just the right amount of garlic and tenderness. 

In the past I've really loved their Mapo Doufu (tofu), theirs is one of the best I've had anywhere. Next time I'm planning on having the Water-Boiled Eel. I heart eel, mmm.

While there are numerous ""famous-chef"" restaurants and buffets galore on the strip, sometimes you just need a break from mass produced hotel food.  

Penang Malaysian Cuisine fit the bill perfectly.  Located on Spring Mountain Road on the second floor of a mini mall, Penang is a medium sized, modest looking restaurant on the outskirts of Las Vegas' Chinatown area.

The menu is extensive and offers a large variety of appetizers, rice dishes, noodle dishes, curries, seafood, beef, pork, chicken, and vegetables.  I loved that in addition to the list of menu items, there are pictures for every dish!  This helped a lot since my husband and I are not all that familiar with Malaysian cuisine.   

We ordered the roti canai, a stir fry vegetable dish with shrimp paste (similar to chinese spinach, ong choy), a spicy curry chicken, and a rice noodle stir fry.  All of the dishes were delicious.   The roti was light, flaky, and hot.  The accompanying curry dipping sauce was the perfect vehicle for sopping up the yummy sauce.  So flavorful and spicy.  The vegetable stir fry and noodle dishes were also tasty.  The star of the show, however was the curry chicken.  OMG!  I wish I had a second stomach to eat more of that dish.  The curry was spicy and dripping with flavor.  Just thinking of it is making my tummy grumble and mouth water...

10th Floor, Venezia Tower.. Walked in here for Brunch. The place had a Classy Decor, Very Professional Staff and Clientele were mostly Upper Class looking individuals. 

Starters:

Bread with butter, jam and ketchup?!: Bread was shaped like a branch with leaves.. something like that. It was hard but the inside was soft and tasted fresh. The butter was kinda hard too, the jam was pretty good and the ketchup I guess was for the fries to come? Who eats bread with ketchup?

Cheese Danish - Looked like a croissant shaped like a muffin, with a dab of some cream cheese butter on top. This was So Flaky/Soft and the cream cheese butter lightly spread throughout was perfectly balanced.. This wasn't your ordinary cheese danish (pre-packaged grocery store bought), this thing was Superb!

Croque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites.. Sounded quite fancy for a breakfast dish - In Layman's Terms = Ham & Cheese Sandwich with Egg and Fries! Toast tasted like a really buttered croissant with an airy texture. Ham & Cheese wasn't the oscar mayer ham nor Kraft cheese I use for h&c sandwiches back at home, it was much more gourmealicous! Plus, with the fried egg, more like a sunny side up egg and their white creamy/frothy sauce, makes an Incredible Sandwich! Fries were served as a generous amount and were plain good. 

Corned Beef Hash with eggs and toast: Corned Beef hash came in shallow bowl with a blanket of overeasy eggs practically covering the hash. I scooted over the eggs to try just the flavor of the corned beef. They were little cubed chunks sitting on top of some pretty tasty juice/sauce. The cubes tasted and had the texture of ham. The juice/sauce gave it a great beef flavor but not the usual Real and typical corned beef I'm used to having. Nevertheless, it was Good. The toast were thick and had a buttery flavor and reminded me of a Crouton. Like a Toast Bread Shaped Crouton?!..

To me, it's ok. As long as you do a good job I don't mind buying from a copy cat. Saryo is a 2 in 1 shop with ramen (Konjiki) and the Saryo café. This review is for Saryo.

I'm a matcha fiend and have to politely disagree with all the other reviewers praising Saryo's matcha. It really doesn't compare with Tsujiri. Tsujiri has a much longer history of doing matcha and Saryo's matcha is simply not the same grade. High quality matcha is supposed to have a subtle sweetness in addition to a slight bitter taste. Too bitter does not mean it's better. Saryo's matcha soft serve is simply not as pronounced and lacks that subtle sweetness I would expect. The texture is also a bit more runny than I would like. 

Also, their selection is much smaller than Tsujiri and most of the pastry items are a notch worse than Tsujiri. 

Customer service wise, I can't get over one of their servers. It's a guy named Taiki I think. Horrible service. If you want good matcha drinks and desserts, definitely go to Tsujiri instead. Prices are about the same but you get less quality at Saryo. I might try their houjicha as that seems to get a lot of praise.",1.0,xVV86BToDOQGxE1gt9MMvg

So, a change in food was very much needed. My co-workers mentioned this restaurant a while ago. Today, I decided to feed my culinary curiosity and order lunch for my co-worker (aka my lunch homie) and I. Harry's Grill and Tavern, here we come! Here are some of the items that we ordered :

Mapleleaf Farms Duck Wings w/Bourbon BBQ sauce and Jicama Slaw

1) Initially, the chicken looked a little parched. Last night's chicken? Ummm, I hope not. However, the taste was decent. Portion size was good. 

2) The Jicama slaw was an excellent take on slaw. Traditional slaw (cabbage) can sometimes become very boring. However, the Jicama put a nice spin on it. The lunch homie, though, with her traditionalist, non-risk taking tongue, let the slaw fall gently from her mouth. You can't please every palate.  

Small Mixed Green Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette and Mac - N - Cheese - Lunch Combo

1) Harry's Mac - N - Cheese was the greatest joy that I experienced during this meal! The consistency and texture was great...not too dry and not loose...just creamy goodness in my belly! The levels of cheesiness was outstanding. And the light sprinkling of panko crumbs provided that last bit of contrast and crunch. The Comfort Food gods have bestowed their blessings on this particular dish.

2) Bought the Small Mixed Green salad to eat for dinner. The portion size definitely small, but it's packed with some good stuff. Can't wait to get my greedy hands on it later this evening!
 
Harry Old Fashioned Burger with a side of Sweet Potato Fries

1) My lunch homie ordered a Harry's Old Fashion Burger with a side order of sweet potato fries. I snagged a few and they were good. I've ordered sweet potato fries at other establishments and I've always needed additional condiments (i.e. Honey Mustard sauce)  to add some taste. However, we both agreed that these fries were great by themselves. The slight sweetness of vanilla gave the side item a little more depth, while the salt reminds you that it's still a fry.

She was less enthusiastic about her burger, though. I believed she said that she had better times with a BK Whopper. Hey, I'm not a burger connoisseur,  so who am I to judge? The presentation of the burger was well put together. Wasn't sloppy or unappealing. Just your typical pub burger waiting to be consumed.

All items were moderately priced. My tab totaled to 31.12. Our lunch take out order was timely ( ready in 15 minutes) and accurate. Great location and if you're a non-parallel parker such as myself, they have easy access to the restaurant from the parking garage.  I will definitely return to see what Harry's has to offer for dinner and brunch.

Over all it was good, I'd say the best was the bread, soft and fresh can't ever go wrong with that. Would I return, probably not, if they adjust the prices and have more lunch specials that are worth the travel then I probably say I would come back and try many other subs.  At least a daily special from 11-2, maybe $7-8 bucks for a 6 inch, soup and a med drink.

Service: 2/5
When we arrived we asked if there was space on the patio and we were told that there was not, and everyone on the patio just arrived so he wasn't anticipating that there would be space any time soon.  So we took a seat inside only to find 2 groups had left the patio 10 minutes later.  We would have waited for a patio seat if we had the option as it was a lovely night.  

When we were greeted by our waiter he told us that we could only order off the summerlicious menu.  But throughout the night, we saw many people ordering burgers (that were not on the summerlicious menu), so I'm not sure why everyone other than us could order off the regular menu...?

Food: 2/5
I had the buttermilk fried chicken as an appetizer and it was good.  My food rating would have been 1 if not for the appetizer.  My boyfriend got the duck buns and said my appetizer was better.  The main course was the maple baby back ribs.  I was looking forward to these all day and was very disappointed.  They were way too spicy and not cooked very well.  Ribs should be falling off the bone if cooked properly - these definitely were not! There was also no plate for the bones or wet naps for us - but that has nothing to do with the food, but more to do with the service.  For dessert I had the brownie ice cream cake and my boyfriend had blue berry pie.  The pie had no taste and was infinitely better than my cake.  The brownie part was so hard that I couldn't cut into it with my spoon.  After two bites (my b/f had to cut it for me!) I decided it wasn't worth the effort - and thereby made history, as it was the first time I've EVER declined a dessert!

Then I asked for a water, and they tried to charge me $5 for a bottle of water.  They wouldn't give me tap water until I lied to them and told them I would vomit if they didn't give it to me.  Seriously - what kind of a place hands out free champagne until it's gone, but won't give out free water?  It's like they want people to get out-of-control drunk.  And to top it off the bouncers were jerks.  Please don't go there - it's a waste of resources.",2.0,OKlIkCZkth5_5onodbMe7w

Decor: nothing special. But clean and their service is great. If you do not like your drinks, you can exchange it with no question asked. That's great customer service especially if you pay $6 for a drink. 

Drinks: their specialty is Fresh Brewed Tea. However, they also have smoothies and coffee too. Their smoothies are not from fresh fruit so do 't expect healthy fruit drinks. The coffe is OK, not strong enough for me. My favorite drink here is the Jasmine Latte. I love how you can customize the sweetness, or add any toppings.

We stayed here back in June 2017. We, my husband and I, were going to Las Vegas for combination of Honeymoon and my husbands 40th Birthday. We invited some friends to join us. We ended up with about 20 of us there. We didnt all stay at the Flamingo. Only 6 of us did. Others stayed in time shares and other hotels. We are platinum members so we got to skip the long line, That was great. We chose the Flamingo because it was iconic. We knew it was a bit older and less expensive so we really were prepared for less fancy than other places. We were ok with that. Good thing too since our mini suite was quite run down and not very clean. Housekeeping obviously needs some training. But we didnt really mind. We had the Birthday party at Carlos and Charlies with all 20 of us. It was great and our waiter , Jason, was the best. We rented a cabana at the Go pool which was pretty nice but the mister in the cabana didnt work and just dripped water all over our stuff. Between my Husband and I and the rest of our party we spent many thousands of dollars. We had saved so we could do anything and everything we wanted and we did. It was great. At the point of getting our bags out of the room and heading down to check out I probably would have given them 4 stars. Quite pleased with the experience to this point....
And that was the point where we discovered that the staff at The Flamingo did not want us to have happy memories. At the check out kiosk we discovered a charge of just over a thousand dollars that we didnt understand. We went to the front desk and were told that someone in housekeeping had gone into our room and noticed sleeping bags and enough luggage for about 6 extra people. -First of all, our do not disturb sign was up the entire time so no one was supposed to go in there at all.-  I told her that was a lie and we wouldnt pay it. She went in the back to talk to a manager and came out with out the manager and with no solution. She called housekeeping and was told the supervisor was not available but that they had pictures to prove it. I asked to see the pictures. They never could supply them. We had to leave to catch a plane but didnt pay. We had agreed with the front desk lady that it would be left as pending until the problem was resolved. After weeks of calling and getting no returned phone calls. Total run around. They never supplied us with pictures. It was a horrible experience. We found out we could contact Ceasars Customer Service so we did. They did call us back and said the charge had been removed. No sorry, No admitting they had made a mistake. It was more like just take it off to get us to shut up. So we dropped it because the charge was removed but never made happy. We will stay at Ceasars properties but never at the Flamingo again.
I hope  it was worth it for you -Flamingo- to try to screw us out of $1000 because I can promise that no one in our 20 person party, many of which are Las Vegas regulars, or anyone any of us ever talk to about it will stay at your hotel. Ceasars is lucky that we love their other properties so much, especially Paris.",1.0,I1CWI5kEY0FujXnmMAB2pQ

We get there and they put my husband and 70 year old dad right in the middle of traffic.  In a very claustrophobic booth.  We ask to move after ordering our drinks.  Took 20 minutes to get our drinks even after we told both waitresses and the hostess helped us move.  Pops and I both ordered the 16oz prime rib so we could have leftovers for lunch the next day.   They bring out our prime ribs and say our baked potatoes are on the way.  Pictures attached.  Almost half of it was fat.  I said oh my gosh that's a lot of fat.  Waitress says nothing.   
Pops and my hubby ordered salads and I ordered mushrooms as my other side.   They bring my daughters and husbands meals came.  A few minutes later we get out baked potatoes.   Hubby says where is my potato?   Well they had given him my mushrooms and he was well on his way of eating them.   So you would think I'd get new mushrooms right?  Nope.  Just slide the half eaten mushrooms to my plate.   Then we order another round of drinks and it takes 20 minutes to get a half chill fireball shot.    
So not a good experience.  If I'm paying $25 for a 16oz prime rib, I should get ""close"" to 16oz.  Not 8oz of meat and 8oz of fat.   
Also it's supposed to be unlimited bread.  How many loaves do you think we got?  Yup 1.

The intercontinental suites are simply ok.  They're clean, they make your bed, bring you towels, etc.  But for the price, I have to give them only 2 stars.  

On the overpriced side, they're well over $100/day for a std room, plus parking is $16 / day, plus wireless for $10 / day.  For that price in Cleveland, I expect at least something special.  That simply wasn't to be found at the Suites.

I ordered room service.  Prices were on par with room service and delivery time was very fast, but my salad appeared as if it had been made a few hours ago and shrink wrapped.  They had a lame selection of beer on room service too.  They didn't even have single beers on their menu, they sold it by the six pack.  I managed to get a single bass which was palatable, but if you've read my other reviews, you know I like the local stuff better.  

The exercise room is pathetic, they converted a former guest room into an exercise room by removing the furniture and throwing in a bike, treadmill, and maybe an elliptical.  I don't remember for sure what was there. I took one look at it and walked out in disgust.  I went for a run instead, but you better know the area if you're going to do the same.  It's not too far from some places you definitely don't want to get lost in.  Head to the university and stay on campus.

It was very different than I expected. Alexander Michael's is in a cute, old house in the 4th ward and has a COMPLETELY different feel than anywhere else in Charlotte. It is a dark, pub feel. I assume they would have mixed drinks, but it's definitely more of a beer place. They have a large selection of local beers, which I love. The night I went it was 100 degrees outside, so I wasn't much in the mood for food.

La Plaza stocks most of the general staples you'd need from most groceries, though obviously there is a strong lean toward mexican, Central, and South American goods.

The fresh guacamole, salsa, and pico de gallo (also available  at the meat counter) are all superb, however there is only one heat rating for both the salsa and pico.  You get what you get, and you'll like it, gringo/a.

The produce section has lots of items that would be hard to track down elsewhere, as well as reasonable to great prices on other more common items.

I first ate at this chain a few years ago on a road trip to Florida and as I was sitting in the car eating my cheeseburger wrapped in tinfoil (commenting that maybe we shouldn't have each ordered a fries because they're HUGE) I complained that we needed this in Toronto. Well now we do! Haha, and unfortunately for my waistline it's uncomfortably close to my house, and just as good as it was in the states. Not much was lost in the cross-border translation. From the bright red and white self-congratulatory decor, to the awesome food and the giant bins of peanuts that fill the room and sate your appetite as you wait for your food: everything has come North. 
The burgers are big (the standard burger is two patties) juicy and fresh. I like to keep the toppings simple (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, pickles), but there's pretty much anything you could want to put on them on the menu. The sesame seed bun does the job holding the messy burgers together and the processed cheese makes the burger creamy and adds just the right amount of flavour without taking away from the burger.
The fries are on par with the burger and as good as some chip truck fries:  big, fresh and crispy. And, as mentioned above, unless your incredibly hungry a regular fries can serve 2 easily and a large more. They actually measure out a heaping portion of fries and dump them in the bag loose to match the portion they give you in the container.
It's not cheap, you're looking at 25 dollars plus for two (share a fries and share a drink: there are free refills), but honestly it feels like you're easily getting your money's worth. No other burger chain comes close.",0.0,TMvcS_zpVt_o9gt3GHhuRw

This place was a disappointment from beginning to end for us.

First thing you need to know is that if you look at the menu, the only place the word prime shows up is in the title.  The steaks are not prime.  And they definitely do not taste like prime steaks.  They may have prime steaks on the menu, but unless it specifically says it is, it ain't.  

Secondly, the service here sucks.  No sugar coating here.  I don't want people to make the same mistake I made and eat here when there is definitely much better in this town.  Go elsewhere for good service, or at least average service.

Well, hopefully I've dissuaded you.  If not, or if you just like reading about poor dinners like watching a car accident, read on.  

We ordered the crabcakes.  And this is where the problems started.  We dutifully split it in half as usual, I began eating and noted it was good, then I bit into a crab shell.  Wow, that hasn't happened to me at any decent restaurant and I've had my share of crabcakes.  Disappointed but willing to overlook this, I bit into another piece of shell.  I'm paying a pretty decent sum for a crabcake that isn't remarkable in any way, and I'm biting into shells?  Unbelievable.

Next up, the salads.  Except we didn't order salads.  They were for the table next to us.  With some horror I realized that our steaks and another table's salads were on the sam f-ing cart, but they served their salad first!  I don't think they do that kind of thing at a Black Angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse.  Horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause.  

My steak was ok.  18 oz bone-in ribeye.  The sauces weren't special but I'm not much of a sauce guy.  However, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me.  Sides were decent.  Truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what I expected.  I didn't much enjoy the bread though.  I got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty.  

And then the final insult.  We finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again.  The second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time.  At this point I hadn't seen our waiter in so long I assumed he actually left.  I thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone.  Why are we ordering dessert still?  I wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs.  After ordering the crepe suzette (17 layers!), we waited a long time for our dessert.  A real long time.  And after finishing what I thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check.  At this point our waiter returned!  We hadn't seen him since we ordered.  Apparently he had been taking care of another table.  He didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult I felt by this time.  He cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant.  It took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks.  By this point we were angry.  We got here at about 6:45, and it was now 9:15.  So we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check.  I won't be back here when there is so much better in town.",1.0,znk9pbzoiaXduZ8REkZn1w

A lot of people complain about this place because they say ""Ooh the cashier was unfriendly"" or ""Oh the food wasn't like an asian master would prepare"" well no kidding you big drungus, it's because you're at Pei Wei and it's like a fast food place if you wanted authentic asian experiences you screwed up already.

Pei Wei is where you go if you want a bowl of noodles or rice and you want some stuff on top with a sauce.  Just order it and move down the line and if there's a table then sit at a table or maybe take it back to you office.  It's just food.  This location is pretty average in terms of speed and politeness, and the food seems to be cooked appropriately so what else do you want?

Here's my PRO TIP: When you go to the place where the drinks are right after you order, get a fortune cookie, but slip it into your pocket, then at the end of the meal, go back and say outloud ""Oh man I am going to get a fortune cookie"" so they don't think you're taking two and then swipe a second one and eat it there.  They've got the most delicious fortune cookies and even though the messages are usually something stupid about sports like ""Oh you're gonna have a good sportsball game tomorrow"" you can still enjoy the cookie, and you've already swiped a second one to enjoy later so you're the real winner - sportsball or not.",2.0,jn6vn65m8uwXLmaTXtQkRw

I showed her pictures of what I wanted and she did a great job! She gave me a long bob that worked well with my wavy/curly hair. I returned back in November to do more layers and to cut my bangs, and Martha did a great job once again. 

Wanting to go blonde for the longest time, I booked an appointment with Aimee this past December. I showed Aimee what I wanted, which was a blonde balayage, and she was really receptive to this and provided good feedback on what would work best with my hair. My hair didn't turn out as blonde as I wanted because it would have been too damaging, but it did look good and very healthy! We agreed to return in a few months to add more blonde highlights to it. I returned today and she did a fantastic job. It's the perfect shade of blonde mixed in with other shades, just what I wanted. 

Based on my experiences, I've paid $60+ for my haircut and $175+ for my hair colour. This is more than I've paid for in the past, but it's also very reasonable and well worth it. The staff are not only talented but are incredibly nice and easy to talk to. I know that I will for sure be a long time customer at this salon.",1.0,ndnUSSsfKtqefxPRQ9gNSQ

The hall is close to the subway which made it easy to get to... probably easier than trying to find parking around there.

I ordered to-go from their lunch menu: sweet and sour chicken with vegetable lo mein and rice ($8).

It took nearly 30 minutes for it to arrive so now I'm rushing back to my office to chow it down. It's a good thing I didn't have to rush because the food was so bland I didn't even bother finishing it. 

I should have known it was going to be gross when my server pulled the lo mein out of a giant rice steamer. The noodles were not seasoned (btw- where were the vegetables in my vegetable lo mein?!) and way over cook. Maybe it was because the noodles have been sitting in the rice steamer all day!

The sweet and sour chicken was pretty much non-seasoned, chicken nuggets swimming in sweet and sour sauce. There were some chunks of green peppers too but I couldn't get over the canned sweet and sour sauce that was infiltrating into my rice pile.

The best part of the meal were the fortune cookies. Mine said-- Next time, drive a bit east and you will find Pei Wei... or maybe that Chicago Hamburger Company across the street will do too!

I've been looking around at the new Nissan Murano. I recently visited Avondale Nissan just to test drive and discuss costs. The people there were very rude and turned me off on buying a new car any time soon. 

The other day I received a personal text from Bryson asking if I was in the market to buy a new car, which I have been. I told him what I wanted over text and about my Juke and finances. He was able to write up a deal and call me with the info which made the process easy! Saved so much time that could have been wasted at the dealership if the numbers didn't come out right. And they got my interest rate at 3.24 when Avondale Nissan was trying to give me 7% which is higher than the rate of my first car when I had zero credit. My credit  is in the 700's so there is no way I should have been ripped off at 7% like Avondale Nissan tried. 

I was offered a trade in value of $9700 at the other dealership. At pinnacle they gave me $12000 which significantly more and paid off my previous loan; even giving me some extra towards the price of my new Murano. 

I was impressed by my experience. John in financing was fantastic and very good at explaining the process. Bryson was also very helpful in making the process as easy as possible. 

I'm picky and the Murano i wanted wasn't available in Arizona so they found it in Nevada and had it shipped. I was told about 4 days and put into a loaner Murano. My new Murano came in a day in a half and is exactly what I wanted.

This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn't notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. 

HINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. 

Sat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong. 

Service is so friendly here. You really get the feeling that these people have been at it for a long time and keep it old school. 

If you haven't been or are on the fence, I highly recommend. Definitely one of the Uptown staples.",4.0,AvC5XQAElcGAAn_Wr5auEg

We stopped there for dessert.  The restaurant gives you the feel of an elegant Irish pub.  They have a pool table, dart board, putting green and HUGE patio!  In the past, I always thought of Kelly's as a bar or late night hang out (which is not really my thing) but I was very wrong!  Their menu looked amazing!  They have an ""award winning"" four cut burger--which I will try next time!  Dessert was delish!  We had the doughnut holes and Kelly's twinkie.  Both were excellent! 

I was most impressed with the service!  We were greeted right away.  While we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us.

Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.

We ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items. 

I was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor. 

I must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?

After this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long.",0.0,H4UHK4Z9kTHbMFOU-xzkpg

At the end I said ""Is that all????"" expecting more but it ended quickly even going out doors and walking the nature trail down to ""Fort Wild"" an outdoor play area. Now I wasn't expecting The Museum Of Natural History in Raleigh, and we did enjoy some of the exhibits, but at  $8 a head plus tax we were expecting way more than what we got.

I got a glimpse of the outside renovations/entrance and it looks good. Now just fix the shitty airport operations....

------------------------------------------

Hopefully the airport completes its rehab quickly... The check in area is in disarray... People walking all over the place with no clear indication/signs for where each airline ticketing location is... I agree construction can be a disruption but clear signage and airport staff guiding passengers will be helpful. 

Just a note: I have been flying out of CLE on a weekly basis for the past 2 months...

To add to the chaos, TSA at CLE is the worst (not that they are good anywhere but you can't get through security in less than 30 mins). One Sunday evening the security line was all the way to the other end of the airport, and guess what there were 3 TSA Pre agents and no one for the regular line??? What were they thinking...

Once you clear security check, the boarding area is clean and organized. Airline and restaurant staff are helpful and there are multiple flights leaving to all major hubs. 

There is a Starbucks right after clearing security and the line moves quick. They are open early am (5:30am) so you can get your fix.

I will come back because I feel like I didn't get into the really good stuff on the menu....but I'm not sure what kind of service I'll receive and I definitely will go back expecting slow service at the very least.

The manager, DJ, transferred from the Tropicana location.  He remembers our names (even though we only go a couple times a month these days) and is always welcoming and friendly.

This location is a bit different than most Wingstop locations.  There is a bar area.  There is more seating than normal.  The walls are lined with TVs showing sports.  I like all these things.

The wings I got on this trip were exceptionally large.  I've never had a problem with wing size at Wingstop and these were even bigger than usual.  I typically get the hot sauce which has a decent amount of kick.  The wings are never undercooked or overcooked and are quite tender and juicy.

I love the ranch sauce.  It's thin without being watery.  Hard to explain, but it's perfect for going with the hot wings.

They have TWO of the coke machines with the touchscreens.  I love those touchscreens, but people can be slow figuring them out.  With two of them there I hardly saw a line waiting for them.

The only negative about Wingstop is the price.  A small soda, dozen wings, and a ranch cost me over $12.",6.0,Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q

Then, our toilet had very low water pressure so I called the front desk who said they would relocate us to another room. 15 minutes later, after frantically packing our things, a guy comes up to the room and says no other rooms are available and they would fix it in the a.m.   ""A"" for effort but ""C"" for the odd answers and possibly... lack of experience? 

Rooms:  Loved the brick walls and hard wood floors INSIDE the rooms - a lot of personality with very high ceilings.  Big bathroom with full bath.  Good blow dryer in the room, iron and board, umbrella, robes, iphone/ipod dock on radio.  Bed was a bit firm for me (I am soft biased) but otherwise comfy.  

Fitness room:  small but my husband said was good enough - had cardio machines and weights.  

We received a free drink voucher for their restaurant upon checkin.  Our friends also stayed in the hotel and opted to buy package deal that included 4 free metro passes and coupons... not sure how much more they spent but they also got a bigger room.",1.0,HvQ45V3LxGbY6-YZ97cvqQ

The prices and quantity is expected as well very small, its not an all you can eat joint and dont expect alot of meat. We had to order another plate pf meat and cold noodles on top of our combo. We told our server maybe we shpuld have ordered the 3 to 4 people portion, he said no its too much food. The portions are really small, the pictures are deceiving. Our server was in a rush on everything, our food, the cooking and when we said we want to order more meat he kinda got dissappointed. Lol. 

We had to ask for cups for our water, more water, rice, napkins pretty much all the basics. Top it off with a piece of hair on our salad which we pointed out and he just said oh I get you a new one. No sorry, oh my gosh, nothing.

You could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  I returned there about 2 weeks ago for AYCE and the experience was quite different.  I went early, about 11:30 a.m. because I knew they are much busier.  There were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I ordered my first round and as I waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  When my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything I ordered but I was glad it came because it took the edge off.  I slowly received more sushi.  The 3 orders of eel that I ordered never came.  I reminded the server.  She said she would check on it.  I waited some more.  I asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  Even though the restaurant was practically full, she was the only server working, ping-ponging from table to table.  Since I had nothing to do I kept an eye on this poor guy at the bar who wasn't even acknowledged for at least 1/2 an hour, not even to be given water.  He kept trying to get someone's attention!  Finally about 12:15, what I thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  FINALLY my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  You could tell it was thrown together.  Since I made such a big deal out of it, I ate it all even though I didn't like it.  I felt so sick after that, even though I didn't get my money's worth I didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  I was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when I arrived I was one of 5 people there.  Then on the way out I noticed a dead roach on the floor, I nearly threw up.

Long version: My husband and I decided to make an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. We booked our hotel two days in advance and winged it while we were there. We knew, though, that we wanted to get a couples massage.

Of course, we headed to Yelp, and read lots of good reviews for the hotel spas, but oh my gosh--$400 for a 50 minute massage? Ouch. No thanks. So, I Googled ""couples massage"" and came up with three non-day spa/hotel places in Vegas. I called all three, checked reviews on all three, and then checked appointment availability and came up with Massage Pro. Booked an appointment sight unseen, and crossed my fingers.

The place is right off the strip--just head west on Sahara for a couple miles. It'd be too much to walk, I think, but it's close enough that taking a taxi shouldn't be too expensive. We had our car with us and it was a very quick drive.

When my husband and I walked into the office, we were a little worried--the reception is super small and feels a little like a dentist's office. We filled out our paperwork, and were taken back to a much more spacious waiting room with dimmed lights, relaxing music, and a little fountain. From there, we were met by our massage therapists. We did have to wait a little longer than we expected, but it was only seven minutes beyond our appointment time, and they more than made up for it during the session. I think they spent an extra ten or fifteen minutes on us to make it up to us. :)

We ordered the 90-minute combination massage, which was a blend of Swedish and deep-tissue techniques. We paid just $90 each! Even with a $20 tip on top of each massage, we were still under the next least expensive massage we could find--and the experience was phenomenal!

We had a male therapist and a female therapist (we had confirmed this was all right when we called and made our appointments) who guided us to a designated Couples Room specially set aside for couples massages. The room was decorated, dimmed, and had soothing music playing. The beds were heated and we were asked if they were to our liking temperature-wise. They were perfect.

Did I mention the therapists are nationally and locally licensed? Yeah. Cool.

So began ninety minutes of rubby, relaxing bliss. The therapists were receptive to our suggestions--a little softer on that spot, please; a little harder right there. The therapists were nothing but the utmost of professionals, watching our muscles for the relaxation of knots and responses to too much pressure. They adjusted their techniques to our preferences and my husband and I had a wonderfully relaxing afternoon. We had very enjoyable massages.

We didn't pack robes with us, and, not being a day spa, they don't provide them, so they were kind enough to let us use their shower usually reserved for customers getting body scrubs so we could rinse off some of the massage lotion. We got big, fluffy towels to dry off with and they even gave us an extra one, just in case.

In short:
UNBEATABLE prices
Professional, personable, skilled, licensed, receptive therapists
Couples massage room!
Not a day spa--ambiance is definitely service-oriented, but still decorated and cozy
Awesome massage
Not sketchy (they have zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior)

He inserted 16 of them from my neck to my ankles and then asked me to guess how many were there. I guessed 6-8. I seriously didn't even feel the others and none of them hurt. They then hooked some kind of electrodes to 6 of them (I was lying face down and couldn't see what he was doing) and sent weak electrical pulses through them. If you've ever had TINS treatments, the amount of current was far less (no muscle twitches) and felt as if someone was gently tapping my back in each spot. Then, they turned off the lights and played New Age type music while I relaxed. I don't know how long that lasted (maybe 15-20 minutes?) because I didn't have my watch on, but it was like taking a nap. After this time, they disconnected the electrodes and removed the needles. I felt very calm and a little groggy at this point. I had told him that I would be playing poker later that evening and he recommended that I take a nap when I returned to my hotel. I took his advice and when I awoke, I felt great! In fact, I was even able to walk from Caesar's to Bally's later to catch the free shuttle without any pain. Sure, that's not a great distance, but there is no way I could have done that prior to my acupuncture treatment. I got a second treatment the next day (my last full day in town) and when I left Las Vegas, I was pain free. Just today (about 10 days later) my lower back pain has been bothering me again (though not as severe), so tomorrow morning I will look up the local doctor whom my friend recommended. I hope he is as good as Dr. Lok! If you are in Las Vegas and have back pain, you really need to go to Dr. Lok.",11.0,PyKaQR0VX8KvPUMk7jy8FA

The whole notion of loading all your belongings into a box and then having the box shipped to the city you're moving to is brilliant and simple...unless you're dealing with PODS. These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, ""Oh yeah. The container arrived last week."" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.
Next was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.
And then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.
My brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.
Bottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.",3.0,cJshXISsMBDVIiUO_mCl1A

I've been familiar with this place since I was a kid, and used to LOVE taking the drive over there. The place is just so laid back, with the giant apple-shaped apple stand on the side of the building, which used to sell candy apples and apple cider, though I haven't seen it open in some time. Maybe I've just been arriving at the wrong time? There's also currently a petting zoo on the other side of the building, with a coin-operated machine that dispenses feed for the animals. 

Inside is your typical tiny grocery store/butcher. They do sell many specialty items that you may not find at a regular grocery store, along with pretty much anything Apple that you can think of. But all of that is foreplay to the main attraction: THE PIES. They have their own little pie patrol that bakes the freshest, most delicious homemade pies, I don't think I've ever bought one that wasn't 100% fresh and amazing. 
I've never really been a pie-guy, but this place is different. And if you don't want an entire pie, they also sell slices. Their strawberry rhubarb is amazing. I've never Jason Biggs'd a pie before, but the s.r. has definitely gotten a couple of suggestive glances from me.

The tribute shows are making the rounds ( Elvis, Neil Diamond, ""Ledgends"") and this tribute show to the Beatles is one of the very best in Vegas. 
A real  benefit of this show is that the ticket prices are $40 -50.00. A great value when compared to other shows with ticket prices spiraling up towards $175 -200.00
The show is presented in two parts, the first part is early Beatle tunes with the four dressed in the neru jackets. The second half is later beatles music with the Fab Four changing into Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club outfits. The final song is a solo rendition of John Lennons ""Imagine.""
Great stuff, great music and a dynamic ending with ""Imagine. ""
This show gets you singing along with all the songs you know by heart - and it does not take much imagination for you to close your eyes and swear that the real Beatles are performing right in front of you. They play their own instruments ( unlike the Monkees ) and have the songs down pat. They even look the part. 
Just really good stuff. Well, well done.

You must go visit their digs, I promise, you won't be sorry when you're sipping a delicious red or white! This space is really beyond words. As soon as you walk in you feel like you've traveled to some far away castle in a romantic foreign city. It's dimly lit, with beautiful dark wood and a fully stocked bar waiting for you to imbibe. 

They have six wines right now, but the grapes are crushed fresh in house (or at least in the presence of the winemaker, Tim), so you know they're not rushing to produce a mass amount of products, just a handful of marvelous blends! My fave of the moment is the Malbec. I've been really into it for a while now and really love their blend. I honestly have had some pretty bad ones, and this is true to form. I also think this is such a white wine type of area, I'm glad to see a place putting effort into promoting the reds.

But here's the other cool thing. They have a downstairs area that matches the same cool vibe of the upstairs. It's thee perfect place for an unique event. It apparently fits around 100 and would be the perfect pick for a small reception or a hip party. I wouldn't care what kind of event it was, I'd want to crash it here! 

They also offer custom labeling, so if you ever need a unique gift this is the way to go! This is seriously the way to go for a nice night out. Just go for the winerific experience and leave with a happy buzz!",14.0,4wp4XI9AxKNqJima-xahlg

I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, ""The Buffet"" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.

First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.

I hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino!

Let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, Blue Martini does not take reservations on Sunday night. They actually are attempting to change a Bar Restaurant into a Night Club on Sunday nights. 
Neo-Soul, a promotion company operating on Sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on Sundays.  On Sunday August 7, 2016, I visited the Blue Martini as I always do several times a month.   During my visits I normally spend  around 100 dollars.  After checking online banking I discovered that I have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid May.
Yesterday I ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  I waited 45 minutes for my wings.  I look forward to eating BM wings on Sunday since it is the only day that I eat Chicken.   Half way through my chicken wings a Neo soul representative came over to where I was sitting with a retired engineer.and a VA Nurse.
The unknown Neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  The first thing out of his mouth was ""Other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. He further stated, I have to ask you if either of you two are disabled"" (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. I was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while I ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. I assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  Instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for Profit.  The promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of Restaurant Regulations.  "" if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool"".  Meaning,If a patron orders food from a Blue Martini Bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  MUST be provided. Blue Martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for Neo Soul to increase it profits.  The Neo Soul rep. appeared surprised when I produced my Armed forces Veterans disability ID as if he was not expecting that. I explained to him I was a Desert Storm Veteran and retired from the armed forces and Las Vegas Metro.  He then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  I was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that I could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  I asked him if there was an emergency and why I could not eat my last two chicken wings.   I explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  He said ""Let's take the disabled veteran out of it"".  I asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. It is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  The Neo Soul rep also felt it necessary to have a Blue Martini Security officer stand by as a ""Show of Force."" We took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  Neo Soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that Neo could increase profits.  Neo Soul is confusing Blue Martini with nightclub practices. Neo Soul and Blue Martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant/Bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  Lastly, He continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.  

Neo Soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are 
false. The first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool. 

Secondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.  
Lastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.  

The entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the Neo Soul rep.  The rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  I would like to reiterate the fact that,  You absolutely cannot make reservations. This entire ""rigged system""  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional Neo Soul reps desperate to make more money. 

I asked  to speak with a Manager at this point.  This manager can only be described as stocky, Latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  He was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the Neo Soul representative's behavior.  He further stated that Neo Soul Rep was unprofessional and to contact Scotty M immediately.
Additionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and I said ""thank you but If you could give us some drink tickets instead.",3.0,rim7FCi4BZMcv7KcaGt5IA

It used to be unlimited, along with all the thinly sliced beef, pork, and sliced chicken, seafood (including crab legs and shrimp), veggies that you can DIY cook in the hot pot at your table.  But for what you are getting and what they are charging, it is still a good value proposition. Come on, for $20 a person without the hassle of getting all the ingredients yourself and the cleaning up afterwards, totally worth it! 

I first came to Shabu Grill all the way to this section of LV because of an UYE hosted by Debbie N.  The event was a resounding success, and we pretty much got to try as much of their menu as we were able to stuff down our faces.

So when a guys night out event was recently organized at this very same location, it was a no brainer for me.  The food is still very good, the service was just as attentive, and the experience just as positive.  The restaurant even accommodated us with extra portable hot pot setups, so 2 instead of 4 or 5 people shared each hot pot.  It just worked out better for us.

The main reason I like this place is the fact that everything for the shabu shabu portion of the dining experience is DIY, including getting the ingredients from the refrigerated cooler nearby.  I love the fact that I can get as little or as much of something, instead of being forced to finished big plates of one item before I can order more or something else.  

The DIY sauce and condiments bar is pretty cool.  Not as extensive as comparable restaurants in SoCal, but you get to customize your dipping sauces as wonderfully or not so fantastically as your creativity and inner toque wearing chef would allow.  But it is pretty hard to score a TOTAL FAIL in this minor endeavor, so relax and just have a go at it.  The important thing is to have fun and enjoy this interactive meal solo, but preferably with a small group of friends.

I would totally go back, especially when the weather is still very nippy in the evening.

Note:  There is a ""bar"" in the front when you walk in, but they do NOT serve alcohol at this establishment.  But if you have room for some beer or other adult beverages, there is a PT in the same strip mall.

I ""Yelped"" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  

My boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.

Okay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.

A very disappointed EX-patron",13.0,82ksBgi3GcayHuPE87zD-w

I needed one very badly, having been using a relative's vehicle for several months, but that they now needed back. I had planned ahead and done my research, and wanted a Ford CMax Hybrid. My work offered a discount/cash-back deal through Cars.com, so I submitted the request and my info was sent to Berge. My plan was to take advantage of the 4th of July weekend specials.

I was almost immediately sent an email from a salesman named Chris. He wanted to know what I was looking for in a vehicle. I replied right away with the details... But the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. There was no response. A few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. I replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. I was anxious with the impending July 4th weekend, but held hope I could still make contact. I decided to call. 

Unfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. That Friday after work, I called and was immediately sent to voicemail. I got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. I left a voicemail explaining that I badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and I asked him to call me  back ASAP. I really needed the July 4th specials. 

The weekend came and went, no reply from Chris. Frustrated, I went to a different dealership in Scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful CMax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend deals and the cash-back deal through my work. TWO WEEKS LATER Chris emails me to say their servers were out of commission, which is why he didn't get my emails, and he would love to help me into a car (this all being said in poor spelling and no caps or punctuation ).

My brother was a car salesman for awhile, so I have a pretty good idea how it goes. I was only given his personal cell number so he could make sure he got my sale instead of anyone else. I'm also an IT student, so I have a very hard time believing their servers were down for two whole weeks. Either they have the worst tech support in the history of ever, or I was put off so I wouldn't have to be offered a holiday deal. Plus, what, did you not check your voicemail??

Rex Marvin is that person. Rex Marvin's search for the greatest food and the most huffable gasoline makes him the tragic figure that in literature would get the girl, save the day, and have the most severed heads in jars in his basement (if it was a Disney book).  The good news people, is that all of those things in real life are true.  If you consider a graveside ditch near the freeway to be a ""basement"".  Rex does. Recently, Rex was accosted for no reason.  Rex and his woman, Three Legged Midget Maggie, were minding our own business.  Rex was casually tossing TLMM up in the air until she was able to grab onto a ledge and let herself in.  Rex tossed her and she didn't come down. A sure sign that TLMM has accomplished her mission. Rex turns around to have 4 metro cops staring at him. They were big. They were not smiling.  Rex decided to break the ice.  Rex asked ""How many buy one get one free garden hose or industrial blacktop sealant coupons does it take to get 4 cops to walk away and pretend like they saw nothing?"" The next thing Rex knew he saw flashes of light. Rex smiled. Darkness. Rex woke up on the floor of a squad car while the cops talked about the loser they beat and were taking into custody. It must have been someone else.

Rex's left eye was shut but he saw that they had stopped at a gas station. They talked about food. They were getting gas station pasta. The smaller one looked back to check on Rex, and said that he was in the mood for ""frozen noodles in sauce"". Rex closed his eyes and tried not to vomit at the idea. He felt with his food that the back door wasn't closed all the way. Rex dislocated his wrists, slipped off the cuffs, and pushed the door open...and much like the time Rex woke up in Candice Bergen's bedroom...he was out before something that could never been taken back happened.  Not going to jail...no Rex can do hard time...but smelling heated frozen pasta is something that Rex will not endure.  Rex has endured more than most. Remember, Rex lived in drag as Jodi Foster's lesbian lover for 3 years...Rex HAS ENDURED! Still everyone has a line not to cross. One of Rex's is frozen pasta...the other is participating in the underground black market 8 track tape racket...lucrative, but Rex only needs to lose 3 toes to know that some money just isn't worth it. Rex has brains.

Rex needed to cleanse himself from the memory of that awful experience...so Rex ran. He crawled. He climbed into someone's trunk. He eventually reached the closest place he could find...Manhattan Pizza.  It is in a strip mall behind a bank and near a place that sells fancy popcorn, and none of that bodes well...but ignore the warning signs and go in.

There are a few staples in an Italian restaurant, and one of them is the Chicken Parm. If you can't make a lights out Chicken Parm then you should close your doors. Manhattan makes a very good one. The chicken is tender, the batter is crispy, the mozzarella is good and the sauce is great. Their red sauce is excellent. Just the right amount of garlic and acidity. The pasta is always cooked well, never over cooked and mushy. The next is meatballs. Manhattan makes a very good meatball; it is almost all meat and no unnecessary fillers. Lastly, can it make a pizza...a great pizza...and Manhattan...excels! Rex is more the New York style pizza kind of man. If you like a doughy crust, you are a hick, and this place might not be for you. They do put a lot of toppings on it, and that is a good thing. 
The truth about Manhattan is the same truth people say about Rex Marvin...almost everything is good.  There isn't too much Rex hasn't tried he didn't like. The fried foods are all good, with a nod to the mozzarella sticks.  The pastas are all good and have good sauces.  The Alfredo could have some more parmesan cheese in it for Rex's taste, but you shake some more on and it is good.  

The prices are too high. Period. The food is good, but Rex finds himself not going because for the same amount of money there are better options. If they dropped the prices Rex would eat there a lot more.

There are a lot worse places to go than Manhattan especially for the pizza. They do a very good job at New York style pizza, not perfect but a very good job.  They obviously care and try hard to make a quality product.  Sometimes they succeed better than others, but it is never awful. Rex can appreciate that. Just like Three Legged Midget Maggie, sometimes it takes a few throws, but she always tries. She always gives an effort...and in the end of the day...that means something.  Rex doesn't know what it means, but it means something.

Mahattan isn't Rex's first choice. It isn't even his second or third, but in a pinch it is good. It is really a 2 1/2 star place. Order right, catch it on the right night, it can be very good. Normally it is just above good. For the money, you can do better than good.",4.0,jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ

I decided to not get ripped for my wife's car (same brake change) so I took it to H-Tech Auto and was charged under a fraction of the what the dealership charged me for the same service AND it took only and hour to do not what seemed like half the day at Toyota Autonation.

I'm not a sushi (or seafood) person so I tried to go in with an open mind since I was the only one in our group who didn't eat sushi. They all loved most of the choices of the rolls they got, the only exception was the appetizer that was ordered. For the price, it was NOT worth it! Was maybe 4 bites worth of food. There was one other sushi roll that wasn't worth the price but I do not remember which one it was. Other than those two things, the rolls were awesome and they almost couldn't finish everything. 

Since I don't eat seafood, I got the chicken katsu. I do believe that it was overpriced for what you got ($14 for 1 chicken breast, a little rice, soup, and a tiny salad) BUT, it was delicious! We are planning on going back to celebrate my husband's birthday there this weekend and I can't wait to order the katsu again and he's looking forward to the Vegas, Dragon, and Blue Flame rolls.

I remembered a number of dead wasps or flies on the windowsill beside me. Ever since then, I dreaded going back. It was not pleasant being in a cafe that wasn't so clean (chilling with the wasps, does that sound like a good cafe experience to you?).

But second time was the charm when I came in, impressed with how full the cafe was. The previous year I went, there were a lot fewer customers. However, despite being full, the cafe was quiet as people worked away or kept their nose behind the newspaper. And no more bugs on the windowsill! Yayy!

To get in touch with its Latin American roots, El Cafecito offers dancing lessons after the cafe closes down and changes the place into a dance floor. They have tango every Wednesday and salsa every Thursday between 7 PM to 10/11 PM. So if you are looking for something new to try, why not with some fun dance lessons to bring out your inner dancing queen/king? With some coffee on the side of course.

Overall, I think this is a sweet place for people who would like to study or work in peace but still be surrounded by people (does that make sense?).

- we asked for water, received it after 20 minutes of asking and we never saw them again 
-asked for soybean paste never got it 

As we started getting full I noticed that we had only gotten one soy bean soup and nothing else, later when I had to go pay I asked about our soups and she said ""oh, you didn't get it, I guess I left it at the wrong table "" like wtf? not even an apologize.
After we received the check and people pulled out cards and cash she started to sigh and look annoyed so I just paid and left. It wasn't until after we paid and left we realized we never got one of the meats.

The pizza slices are smaller than normal so you can try many different kinds. The ""Portuguese"" (ham, cheese, egg, peas and onions) and the four cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gorgonzola and catupiry) were the best ones, in my opinion.

Yeah my next popped and I could not move my neck! I swear I cried all day because I was in pain. I stayed home thinking by the next day I would feel better. Nope. I was worse. So I looked up for a chiropractor. Keep in mind I also don't have health insurance because that is expensive as hell. 

I find this place and it has 5 stars. I call and this amazing nice lady answered the phone. I forgot her name unfortunately but she was so sweet. She told me to go in and the doctor would see me. 

I go in and immediately they start working on me. I apparently tore a muscle and that is why I was in pain and could not move my head! I was scared and I talked to Dr. Brandon Wentzel about the wedding I was going to be attending at 6 that day. He promised to make me better and that I would be able to move. 

Guess what? He did! I left the doctor place able to move and even though I still had pain it lowered from a 10 to 1!

The Mexican Rice was really good as was the taco meat, seasoned well and was tasty.  The BBQ sausage was good, and so were the BBQ Chicken Wings.  The BBQ Ribs were tender and tasty.  I had Apple Cobbler and Carrot Cake with frozen Vanilla Yogurt (Ice Cream?) on top.  The quality of everything I ate was better than what is served at other Station Casinos.

This is my favourite  new restaurant of 2017. Aloette is the casual sister to Alo, upstairs. The room is long and narrow, and feels like a cross between a classic diner and an upscale train dining car. Waiters bustle around the tight space creating a fun, busy atmosphere.

We sat at the bar. No reservations are taken but we walked right in at 6:00.

We started with beef tartare and fried smelts. The tartare was good and went well with the fresh horseradish included. Smelts were crispy and lightly battered. A nice surprise were the fried jalapenos that went surprisingly well with the fish. The real star though was the free cheesy toast and butter.

The mains were absolutely delicious. The cornish hen was cooked perfectly crispy and was an umami explosion with mushrooms and spinach, but could have used a tiny bit more salt and/or sauce. The burger with fried cheese on top was fantastic. Now that the Harbord Room is closed I think this is now my favourite restaurant burger in Toronto.

For dessert we had the apple pie sundae and a cup of strong coffee.

Service was impeccable. My wife was given samples of two wines to compare when she couldn't decide, a touch that I always appreciate. The wine list could be a bit more extensive but this is a quibble. A fantastic new spot. We will be back.",1.0,oerw70Uc1dQl8t-86fOUsg

My boyfriend went to U of I and we somehow stumbled upon this hidden gem. Well, I suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. But don't be discouraged! The wait is well worth it, I promise. 

Try to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. There's not much space in this place. I guess that would be my one complaint. It can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. However, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? Now, let's talk about this beer.

They have new selections on tap all the time. Please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (Miller, Bud, Heiniken, Corona, etc). Those are just fine for any regular restaurant. Why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? Seriously, these beers are amazing. They come from different breweries across the country. Places/companies you've never heard of. Combinations of flavors you would never think to try. I once had an oyster beer here. Sounds disgusting but it was so good. Trust me on that. I'm very picky and I liked it. You can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). This flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. You can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!

Now, on to the food. So SO good. There are a few different sauce choices you can get. Not being one for spicy, I get the Georgia Peach. It is soo good on anything you get. There is no bad item on this menu. The pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. Hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. The brisket is also amazing. They cook it for 12 hours. How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. This way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. They cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. Oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.

I know this was a long review, but I really can't say enough about this place. I'm obsessed. It's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near Chicago. However, I will make any excuse to go down. Going there this weekend for Halloween. Can't wait to visit my favorite BBQ place in all the land!",0.0,lg1UvP-7KLtjSdxbFbt3Aw

I was referred here by my relative that knows the now famous Clarance, the owner of the place.  I told him I am the niece of such and such and he said he remembers them.  I didn't have insurance for glasses then he gave me a very reasonable price.  He is very friendly and chatty, and despite our age difference (I am probably not much older than his children) we became quick and great friends.  I even go over just to chat after I got my glasses.
Now years later, he is still a good friend, and everytime I go in he always ask about my grandma.  It is hard to find good service nowadays, and he kept it up all these years.  His business had grown (and I have to admit I had send some friends there also) and you might need to wait a bit longer for his ""personal"" service, but the other workers are very nice and helpful too.  His prices are still reasonable and with great selections.  I can't imagine to go anywhere else for glasses now.",1.0,Hxjcloe2LCoG5HZratFsHg

The menu that I was ordering from confused me a bit because I was wondering, where were all the Greek items such as pastitsio, moussaka, saganaki, bakalava, and spanakopita?!?!? 

People have said that the menu was downsized but the only thing I could find that was greek was Gyros, Falafel and dolmades and souvlaki and I went with the Gyro. The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old. The fries were on a greasiness level of their own. I have never had such soggy fries. 

The service was certainly some of the most friendly I have had in sometime and the proce for the Gyro combo really is hard to beat it came in right around $6.

So...the food is really tasty here & the ingredients are nice & fresh. The beef broccoli is some of the best I have had. The beef is really quite good.

They also have really good lunch specials & you definitely cannot beat the prices here.

After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered. 

A few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.  

I called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.

A month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.

Tonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.  And as expected, no sauce for the crab wontons, no napkins, no soy sauce & no fortune cookies.  

I don't think we will be going back anytime soon - at least not to this location - they really need to get it together.  We're tired of the issues every time we eat in or get take-out from here.",3.0,Y-eZiZcWFbjgFUyGNdQ7Dg

Above Toronto's landmark breakfast place Fran's, Screen Lounge is a 2-level resto-lounge - I can see hanging out in the sleek indoor bar area this winter, but during this extremely hot summer, it's the roof-top patio all the way. It's got a huge outdoor seating area, comfortable and modern red-and-black-cushioned patio furniture and back-lit bar that looks very Miami as the sun goes down. The chill-out music sounding from the speakers adds to that 'sit-here-and-chillax-for-as-long-as-you-want' vibe.

Prices are a bit steep for this area (like I said, think King West!) but the staff is super-attentive and the food portions are a good size.  They've got some creative sushi rolls (try the Canadian, wrapped in bacon) and tasty tempura appetizers. It would be great if you could order Fran's brunch on the rooftop patio on a Saturday or Sunday morning...I hope that is in the works!

The diverse French cuisine will appeal to Francophiles, and the comprehensive wine selection will appeal will oenophiles.

The French have always done brunch well (partially due to their social belief that drinking after 12 pm is acceptable, even admirable).  Marche Bacchus is my favorite place to go in Vegas for a brunch that makes me forget I live in the Mojave dessert.  Also, the restaurant offers both their brunch and lunch menu at this time, which offer many more authentic choices than just their dinner menu.

If it's spring in Vegas, I order the Moules Frites, mussels in white wine butter sauce with crusty baguette, a light and delicious classic that Marche does well; don't forget the Mimosa.  

If it's summer, I order the lobster avocado croissant, pair it with a Riesling from the market; the sweetness of the Riesling highlights the lobster and brings out the richness of the avocado.  

If it's fall, I order the duck confit & fettucini pasta, it's a calorie splurge but completely worth it.  

And if it's winter, I get the Les Oeufs En Meurette, three perfect poached eggs in hearty red wine sauce with ham and mushrooms; it's a dish that warms your stomach, and your heart; break some rules and order a glass of Cotes Du Rhone with it: red wine works for daytime when it's Vegas harsh dry winter.

I cannot begin to say how bad it was.   I ordered an egg salad sandwich on a bagel and coffee. A simple enough order, or so I thought.  How bad could it be, you're thinking?    Let me tell you:  undercooked eggs with bright yellow, hard jelly-like yolks, chopped in HUGE chunks with an enormous amount of tasteless, gooey mayonnaise on a Montreal sesame seed bagel (the bagel was good).  

Salt, pepper or any kind of seasoning never saw that 'egg salad'.  It was served with potato chips and a side order of POTATO SALAD??  and a pickle.   Talk about a starch redundancy!   The coffee was tepid at best, and the milk I poured into it had some suspicious looking 'flakes' on the coffee that made me think it's last good day was yesterday.   

The presentation was attractive, but what good is that when the food was almost inedible??   I spent almost $9 for food that I could not stomach.

My package includes an initial assessment, unlimited training and yoga sessions, The Fit Labs Diet and Exercise Journal, The Fit Labs Diet guide, up to 2 sessions per month with a Fit Labs Coach and unlimited email support. 

Even after my workout today, James texted me to find out how I was feeling and see if I needed anything.  That's amazing personal attention!  

It's going to be fun working out here and meeting new fitness friends!",3.0,VtLdzz_1olnpRU6AuSsEVg

The food is hot and fresh! You can customize your burger order with a variety of buns which is a plus and they offer bottomless fries AND broccoli.

At first, I was really turned off by the ""tex-mex"" concept and even the name ""Mesa Grill"" didn't sound too appetizing, but we took a risk... and Bobby delivered.  We came here for my husband's 27th birthday and he had a wonderful time.

SERVICE: 
5 Solid Stars!  The hostesses sat our party right away even though not everyone was there.  We were immediately served water and asked if we wanted any cocktails.  I really loved our waiter.  He wasn't just polite and attentive, but he was also engaging us in wonderful conversation throughout our meal.  He talked to us about how long he had been working there, and what Bobby's like... and he knew the menu like the back of his hand.  It was like having a new friend dine with us throughout the duration of our meal.  I wish I caught his name so I can give him props!

FOOD:
Bread Basket - 2 stars.  They start you off with a variety of breads.  There was a jalapeno one, another one with some blue corn in it, and a third one that I can't recall.  All were very unique, but unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  I didn't think the bread was very soft or moist, and the flavors didn't do it for me.  Kudos for thinking outside the box though.  The butter also wasn't the soft, spreadable kind.

Blue Corn Pancake - 5 stars.  This appetizer came highly recommended by our server.  There was barbecued duck inside pancake (like a glorified taco), and a habanero chili star-anise sauce drizzled all over it.  The flavors all worked so well together to deliver an explosion of flavors in my mouth.

Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla - 4 stars.  This was larger than expected!  It is pretty filling and could easily be substituted for a meal as a filler.  Or you can split this between 2-3 people and share it as an appetizer.  It's a pretty heavy dish and hard to eat too much of.  There's a large fried egg on top of a tortilla.  Embedded in the tortilla is smoked tomato salsa, grilled green onion, and crispy artichokes.  

For our entree, my husband and I shared the New Mexican Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin even though I was realllly eyeing the 22 ounce bone-in Ribeye.  The waiter said the pork tenderloin was their signature dish so that's why we ordered it even though I'm not a huge fan of pork.  It wasn't until the dish arrived that we were convinced we had made the right choice!!  WOW, that was one tender, delicious, savory, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat.  The spice rub added a bit of heat, and I can easily say this is the best piece of pork I've ever been served.  It came with a side of the most amazing tamale.  I can't even begin to describe how good it was.  You just have to try it.  5 Stars for this entire dish!!!

I sampled some of the other dishes from my friends, but the pork dish was the definite standout.  My friend ordered the lamb chops, but they tasted a bit gamey and weren't as tender as they could've been.  The pan seared Halibut was tender and flaky paired with a lovely curry spice reduction.  I'd give both these dishes 4 stars.  

All in all a wonderful experience.  Glad I finally got to try one of Bobby's restaurants!",4.0,ypm9IB9iZkwY71FKkYeLkg

1. Cookies and cream cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with hot fudge on top

2. Peanut butter cookie and white chocolate macadamia nut with butter pecan and Heath bar bits

3. Chocolate chip cookie white chocolate macadamia nut salted caramel fudge ice cream with Heath bar pieces

The ice cream is rich and thick.  The cookies are satisfactory. The chocolate chip was similar to a basic  Toll House recipe. Which I find rather boring   The blandness of that type of cookie is a good platform for the ice cream 

The strawberry cheesecake ice cream had chunks of strawberry cheesecake in it. The taste was excellent 

The butter pecan was lacking in flavour ..... Would give that flavour a miss next time

The real winner was the salted caramel fudge ice cream. The caramel was so warm and inviting and then the super huge chunks of fudge were amazing. 

The heath bar tipping added that extra toffee taste the was ""the icing on the cake""

The fudge on the strawberry cheesecake combo didn't add much to the dessert. Also made it near impossible to pick up. Although ordered on the side (if possible ) and dunking the cookie ice cream creation sounds rather like a good option.

His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.  

A friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. 

  We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. 

  Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.

20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.

I think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.

I called Akahana and spoke with the manager who gave me the soy sauce, and while he offered to make some new sushi for me, I didn't take him up on it. I also didn't ask for a refund.

I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff.

I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: ""patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance"". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance.

On a lovely holiday Monday, after some frisbee in the park, some friends and I decided we needed some food.  The Abbey seemed to fulfill all necessary criteria.  The criteria being: patio, beer and tasty food.  
Well, it had two of the three, however, those two were not enough to redeem this place, especially in light of the laughably awful service.
Now, I'll admit that three of the people in our party got their food and enjoyed it.  However, two of us were not so lucky.  
First we were given the wrong food.  The one other person who ordered at the same time as us (we sort of ordered in two shifts) got his food.  They took back our messed up orders, with the excuse that the computer wasn't working and thus the orders were messed up...uh okay.  Twenty minutes later we recieved the food we ordered, just as our friend was finishing his meal.  Unfortunately, my greek salad came topped with fetid feta cheese and the caesar wrap came complete with bugs squished on the lettuce.  
The good news was that the food was comped.  However, it took us a little too long to pay as the debit machine phone line was being used by a disgruntled employee to complain about her employment situation and to utter expletives in that regard.
Needless to say we won't go back.  There are too many awesome restaurants and patios to waste any more time there.

This Marble Slab Creamery is tucked away in the corner at the food court inside Market Mall. It's hard to miss however because when you step into the vicinity, all you can smell is the sweet scent of waffle cones. And considering you can smell THAT in the middle of a food court - that's pretty damn good!

Their ice cream is made daily in-store and they definitely hold true to their slogan: ""The Freshest Ice Cream On Earth"".

Marble Slab has an insane amount of flavours. Everything from Vanilla Cinnamon to Cotton Candy. And of course to celebrate the holidays, they also have Egg Nog and Pumpkin Flavours. Oh, and did I mention that you get to choose mixins?!?!? So not ONLY do you get to pick the flavour of ice cream you want, but you get to pick the mixins you want mixed in. We're talkin anything from chocolate bar pieces, to fresh fruit. So it's basically like a blizzard or a Yogen Fruz but in a cone, and with the freshest, most delicious ice cream you can imagine. Once you've picked your ice cream flavour and your mixins, they mash everything up right in front of you on a frozen counter. Then once it's all perfectly mixed, they scoop it into a cone (or a cup of you prefer) and you're good to go.

I haven't even mentioned yet that they also sell cakes, take-home pints, shakes, floats, smoothies and frozen yogurt.

The studio and it's salesmanship/service is decidedly less than impressive.   I ordered two pieces, Gorillas in The Mist and Tree of Truth.  The original art dealer who made our transaction was let go for untold reasons and was replaced by someone else(Mike?).   I only know this because I called to get a follwup on the delivery of the photographs because I have yet to hear from the guy who took over the account.  I think if someone took over the account, they should be taking the initiative to notify the customers of that change.  I basically had been getting no response from the emails I sent to my original dealer, and I had to call to find out what happened.

About four weeks later, I received the Tree of Trurth(alternatively called Wisdom Tree).  However, it was only by accident that I received it.  I stopped by my local USPS office to pick up an article by another merchant, and to my surprise the clerk brought me a package from the Rodney Lough Studio.  I have no idea how  long it had been at the USPS office, because I was never notified by Mike, or frankly anyone from this Las Vegas studio that the piece had been shipped out.  I wasn't notified by USPS either, but we all know and expect crappy service from the USPS - the main difference is that I didn't pay USPS thousands of dollars for a certain level of service.  

I am left wondering:

If Rodney Lough Jr. Sells their pieces of artwork as being something of value and something to treasure...Why would they send it via the UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE like its junk mail?? Why not give the customer at least an email notification that it has been sent out???

I wonder if the people at the Peter Lik galleries provide better customer service?  Something that extends beyond the swipe of the credit card?  

I am glad the Wisdom Tree was not lost or damaged in the USPS office, but I certainly expected better service than I have received.  Still waiting on the Gorillas in the Mist....hopefully it will be delivered to my door like they originally promised, and not by USPS.",7.0,oiS3KxE45BK05OqGjoRRxg

My dogs nails seem to grow an inch a day and he will fight to not have them trimmed. I have taken him multiple places but haven't had the success I have here. They let me in the room while they trim his nails so I can hold and comfort him, plus they do all their grooming behind a window so you always know what is going on. I drive twenty minutes out of my way to come here because we consistently have a fantastic experience. 

I prefer to wash my dog myself (so I don't have any experience with the additional grooming services they offer). The facility is always clean, easy to use and the employees are super helpful (and seem to really enjoy their jobs). They have everything you could need to groom, including toothbrushes, brushes, and towels/dryers. I always go with the basic wash and have been very happy with it (about $15). Their pricing is the same no matter the size/breed. My dog is about 45 pounds so for me it's worth it but might not be if you have a tiny dog. 

The food/treats are great too. Super healthy brands that I can feel good about feeding my dog. They sell toys/leashes/collars as well. We always end our trip with one of their bakery items, which my dog gobbles up.

The salumi plate was nice but a little on the small side and lacking in variety, with only three meats. The pizzas looked good but were pretty tasteless - the cheese was bland, the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness, and the crust was dried out and lacking flavor (probably a result of the electric oven).

Therefore all the mediocre reviews below should take into account that this property is in transition.  I first stayed here back in the 80's and gradually watched it deteriorate.  So its current condition is great in comparison.   The rooms no longer look like photos 11 and 12 posted above. The rest are up to date.

* Positives:  Flat screen TV's on wood laminate TV walls, furniture has been updated since the photos posted, IKEA lighting, temperature controls in each room (but older units), very clean and loved the wood flooring over nasty hotel carpeting.  The current internet rate is $72/night.  How can you beat that in a central Toronto location? I like that you need to use your room key to move the elevator. This stops strangers from accessing the upper floors as the desk can't see the elevators.  There is a security guard on at night.  A concierge will also be located in the lobby in the future. 

* Negatives:  The awful drapery and the bathroom still needs some improvement.  The room is small but no different than any other budget hotel.  The lobby and restaurant are being renovated so you have to deal with that.  Paying $10 a day for wireless is a bit too much.

Tonight on our way back from the hospital and being Labour Day we thought we would call them to see if they were open. So I got Siri going and got the number. I dialed it and asked if they were open. The lady on the phone said that they were very busy and that I should make a reservation. I did and off we went. When we got there the first clue that something was amiss was that the place was nearly deserted and they could not find my reservation. We took our seat and proceeded to order. Not five minutes into this and we get a call from a local number, it was the first restaurant we called wondering where we were. As it turns out the owners of Cynthia's created a tangent restaurant called Cynthia's Paradise and put it literally right next door. Talk about confusing your market. Given the way the night was going to unfurl we should have packed up and gone next door.

I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup to start. This is one of my favourites and when I looked at the $4.95 price tag I assumed we were going to get a bowl big enough to share. When it came I got this little golden globe before me which revealed inside an even smaller ceramic bowl which if it held 1 cup of soup I would have been amazed. The soup was adequate. It has a nice balance of all the flavours I am used to but in no way was this worth 5 dollars. I mean for just one dollar more at another chinese restaurant I got a bowl of soup so large that it would have filled that little bowl before me 20 times over. What really drove the point home though was the little tiny $3.50 Egg Roll and the 2 HarGow for $4.50. This place was way over priced. So maybe the service was going to be exceptional. I mean, there were more people on the floor, behind the counter and that could be seen in the kitchen than there were patrons sitting at the tables. The 2 HarGow came one at a time in the tiniest steam boxes I have ever seen. We ordered Moo Shu Pork, Chinese Broccoli and the House Special Fried Rice. The food took way longer to get to us than was comfortable for me but taste wise it was very good. Far too expensive but very good. Ended the meal with the Deep Fried Creme Brulee and with a 13% tip the meal came out to $94.75.

Frankly I can think of a number of places that I would like to spend that kind of money for 2 people. Cynthia's Chinese Restaurant is no longer one of those. As a comparison the meal at Cynthia's Paradise would have cost $54 for two people all you can eat. I will do a review of Paradise when I go there but this place will never see another dime from me.",2.0,VVIJ4BErUjxLikGTaMoSXA

The place is small and properly furnished with wooden tables, wooden counter top, and wooden light fixtures. The brick wall gives some needed warm and character. 

We may went there on a cold evening but reality is that the place was fairly cold and I had to keep my jacket on while in there. Not very pleasant.

They don't take reservations but as long as you arrive before 7PM I think you should be fine.

I opted for having their featured dish, a buttermilk fried chicken with coleslaw, biscuit, and collard greens. At first I thought that the chicken was moist but it ended up being somewhat dry. It was a bit on the flavorless side (disappointed). The collard greens were great and so was the biscuit. The coleslaw was very average. They did not win me with that dish.

Aft Kitchen and Bar  did not have a cocktail menu but they had a list of available wines. I had a chardonnay from Estrada Creek and the wine also did not wow me.

I also stock up on my hard alcohol at Total Wine and have recently discovered they have a decent selection of cigars.

The store is pleasant, with kind of a woodsy warehouse feeling to it.  Most of the staff are knowledgeable and pleasant.  The prices across the board are reasonable.  They have long hours and tons of parking.  Maybe the only slight downside is they chose to locate in Desert Ridge, which is not a mall that is easy to just pop in to.

It was yesterday, a day with freezing rain. When I called in and made reservation in the Morning, I didn't think it'd be a full house on a day like this( April snow). I'm so glad that I did when I arrived this hidden gem in a not so busy neighbourhood. 

We ordered cheese Jalapeño for starter, osso buco and braised lamb for main. Everything was delicious!!!! So richly infused with all kinds of spices! The cheese jalapeño looks a little unpleasant under the red neon light, but after the first bite, we are totally sold!! Both osso buco and braised lamb come with tostadas and beans and rice, no need to order separately. The portion was quite generous for two girls, next time we will probably cut one main and do one more starter. 

My only criticism would be the size of the table. For Mexican food, it'd be great if we have a little bigger table for the many dishes. But I understand that it is built upon a small townhouse, won't be able to have so many people if the table is bigger. 

Advise before going: 

1,it's going to be fully packed, make your reservation early.

Typically hotels in Vegas are known for being extremely catering to their guests. This was not the case. Plus the whole hotel looks like absolute crap filled with the scummiest people. 

Next, my room was absolutely filthy. There were piss stains running down the toilet to the ground, it also smelled like someone died in my room. The bed felt like I should have brought a black light and possibly a hazmat suit. Best part about my room was the AC actually working, but the shower/tub looked like someone had just washed their cars undercarriage in it. The towels felt like sand paper and were barely large enough to be considered bath towels....more like hand towels. Getting a cab is nearly impossible since no where does it say you are required to tell the front desk to call a cab or just call it yourself, since they don't employ someone at the entrance to wave cabs for you. Their room service isn't insanely over priced like most Vegas hotels, but there's a reason for that, everything tastes like it had been made 24-48 hours earlier.

Lastly and most importantly, after surviving 3 nights in this dump, I was brushing my teeth the following morning when I noticed a fairly large cockroach scamper across the sink.

After all this I literally slept at my friends hotel the final night to avoid puking in my own mouth or getting some rare form of malaria.

If I told you how much I paid to stay at this sh*thole, you would kick me in the d*ck for being such a dumbass. 

In the end I feel like I got raped for my hard earned cash just so I could save a little. Definitely learned my lesson and going to spend the extra cash to stay at a real hotel next time.",3.0,zSqMbeNZXI-qippJ_vLmfw

The first time I sampled some bites from Savoy was at a Yelp event last year; unfortunately it took me quite a long time to make my way back, but I after the meal I had last week I think the wait was worth it. I went here for dinner with a family member on a Wednesday night - as a result the place was pretty quiet when we arrived. After checking our coats (this is more or less mandatory as they don't let you drape them over the chairs) we were seated at one of their comfy downstairs lounge tables, and we explored the menu, ordered, and proceeded to enjoy an excellent meal.

Firstly, there was the fresh free bread with oil and balsamic for dipping. I was quite hungry so this was a great start. One note, though - beware the spicy bread! We're pretty sure jalapenos were baked into a couple pieces. Tasty for some, not ideal for people like me though.

Then there was the drinks. My dining companion ordered a blackberry Cosmo (made with ingredients like blackberry moonshine - quite a nice touch), and I ordered the Starburst. Both of these drinks were superb; the Cosmo was a first-rate drink and oddly enough, my Starburst did indeed remind me of Starburst candies - but was still muuuuch tastier!

As for the food - just, YUM! My companion ordered tomato soup and a pear salad. The salad was flavorful (though pretty standard in terms of salad ingredients), and the tomato soup was simply amazing - in addition to its freshness and being the perfect thickness it came with grilled cheese sandwich squares instead of croutons. More restaurants need to do this with their tomato soup, it was just so good! As for me, I ordered the 2015 restaurant week special - hen with bacon mac and cheese and a side of kale - and this was simply divine. I have yet to find such tender, juicy and well seasoned chicken in the city, plus the mac and cheese wasn't overly cheesy and had the bacon flavor infused into it. The result was that it wasn't too rich and it went well with my chicken and kale. The entire meal was also served with a side of tomato gravy, which was basically a thicker version of the tomato soup I'd sampled and fallen in love with already. I couldn't have been happier with what I ordered.

The clincher for our excellent meal was the fantastic service we received throughout the night. All in all we thought Savoy had amazing food, fantastic staff and a very chill but warm atmosphere. We would absolutely come back - hopefully my next meal here will involve sampling the amazing looking brunch menu!",4.0,M9TjYmTgHayJ22cNkyvW_g

Why again do you ask? I just purchased a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu from this dealership, and I went here after work to pick up the green slip so I can register the car with the DMV. 
TIP: Customers who buy or lease vehicles here: DO NOT have to go to the DMV to register your vehicle. You simply use the dealerships control number on the green slip to enter in the DMV website and it will bring up the vehicle you bought. You can then transfer or request new plates (standard only plates) and the DMV will mail them to you. This is handy, because we ALL hate the DMV. 

Back to my review of AutoNation Buick GMC of West Sahara round 2. So I got the green slip and I was ""just looking"" at some of the Buicks on the lot. Buick has come along way in the last 10 years or so. This is NOT your grandfather's or grandmother's Buick anymore. I had a 2013 LEXUS ES 300h that got 39MPG highway and 40MPG city. It had quite a few bells and wistles. Anyway, I began by driving a V6 powered 2016 Buick Lacrosse and Devon and Denzell were my points of contact again. I really liked it. This one didn't have the same equipment that my Lexus does, so I didn't really want this particular car, as I didn't want to go down in car quality or caliber. Then I drove a 2014 Chevrolet Impala V6, and loaded with everything for that model year with 22k miles and they were asking 25k for it. I really liked this car. It wasn't a Lexus or a Buick, but it was cheaper than either one of those and it was fully loaded. But I was contemplating replacing my business car, which was my Lexus, and I already had a V6 powered Malibu that I bought for 16k with 32.5k miles two weeks earlier from this same dealership, and the same sales people (Devin and Denzell). It took me forever to decide even after driving a brand new 2015 Buick Lacrosse that had just about everything my Lexus did minus the front parking sensors and the dash cam, but I can replace the dash cam later (which I will at this dealership for both my Malibu and Lacrosse). I got a Heads Up display system with forward collision alert, I got a Bose audio system, a panoramic sun roof, remote starter system, and a wifi hotspot powered by onstar. These features my Lexus didn't have. 

I was given multiple options, and a lot of time to decide which vehicle I wanted out of the three, the Chevrolet Impala, or the 2015 V4 eAssist Buick or the 2016 V6 Buick. I ultimately chose the 2015 eAssist V4 Buick Lacrosse based upon what I was going to be doing with the car, showing Real Estate. I was offered an unbelieveable deal too. Because this vehicle was a 2015, and was sitting in the showroom, and the 2016's were already here and more were coming, this car was priced at 35k. Originally it was 41k which was understandable. If I bought my Lexus ES 300h brand new, it would have been 47k easy. I know cars, and how to shop for the ones I like or want. So I knew I was getting a deal on this new car. Also, I was given a 2k tax credit for my Lexus, and AutoNation gave me another $800.00 off on the car, because I am a repeat buyer, and I didn't waste anyone's time. Thank you David! 

So I still had 1k of negative equity to deal with, and that was done by lowering my interest rate from 4.9% with Lexus to 3.9% through AutoNation Buick GMC's contacts. Can you say Credit Unions anyone? If you want great financing go see the fine people at AutoNation Buick GMC, they WILL find you a good deal, if it takes all day. They don't just use traditional banks or manufacturer banks like most dealerships do, which all charge higher interest rates, trust me I've been there. 

So in combination of lowering the interest rate again to 3.45%, and further dropping the price of the new 2015 Buick Lacrosse, I wrapped up my negative equity and came UP about 2k. This shows in the contract as down payment money which is true because I verified how the dealership got the numbers. So I got a brand new Buick Lacrosse, with an extended warranty, prepaid oil changes for 3 years on top of the 2 years given to you by GM (General Motors), theft protection and GAP insurance and my payments are $616.00 per month versus $647.00 a month with Lexus without the theft protection, or the prepaid maintance plans. Lexus doesn't offer standard oil changes for the first 2 years either. 

What's more, my Buicks engine, transmission, and final point of assembly are in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Just like my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu. The major components of these cars are made here. Just read the window sticker, it will tell you where the major components are made. We need jobs in this country badly. I don't need Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump to ""bring back the jobs"" to the United States. We can all do our part by giving GM, Ford or even Fiat Chrysler a chance. Personally, I am a GM man. I loved my Lexus, but I love my country, my Buick, and the sales team at AutoNation Buick GMC even more. They also hire the veterans!

We found a seat immediately and our server was over shortly thereafter, told us the wing/beer special, took our drink order and off she went.
When she returned, we ordered our dinner and some appetizers. Appetizers were Mac and cheese triangles...absolutely the greasiest, worst tasting item I've ever put in my mouth at a restaurant. Potato skins were very dry...no flavour at all.
Some of us ordered the wing dinner, which was wings, fries and a soft drink (no refills). The fries came out as an appetizer...not with the wings. They were basic fries and pretty flavourless.
When our food came out, it came out at different times. 2 people got their order (one was a wing dinner and the other a burger dinner) while a 3rd was returned because the person who brought out the wings could not tell us which type of wings they were. She said she would be right back with them, but she answered a phone and talked on it for an awfully long time. 10 minutes later, those wings were brought back out, with the other 3 wing orders. WTF?
Wings were a huge disappointment. While meaty, they were sprinkled with minimal sauce....no  flavour at all. We would have sent them back but we never saw our waitress until 20 minutes later....she was serving other tables, on the phone, settling bills, etc.

WHAT I GOT: Cheese ribs

PROS: Repeat after me. You can NEVER go wrong with meat and cheese. EVER. And my goodness, James Cheese Back Ribs is winning the restaurant game. You get a pool of gooey cheese that the server wraps around each rib along with extra corn, two different mashes (sweet potato and regular potato), mini sausages, and scrambled eggs. The ribs themselves were coated in this beautiful and super flavorful sauce, and the meat was super tender as well. Literally fell off the bone with one bite. They also give you scissors and some plastic gloves to keep your hands clean, along with the option to choose the heat level of your ribs. We went with mild, which honestly is not spicy at all, so if you're looking for even a little bit of a kick, I would suggest the regular spicy option.

CONS: Ok well the price is pretty hefty. Not gonna lie. And the sides aren't exactly the most tasty things ever but combined with the cheese, usually anything will taste good. But be warned, the server will turn off the gas stove that melts the cheese once all the ribs are wrapped so the cheese will start to get hard again. If you wanna dip your sides, eat those first. And the ribs are a bit on the small side so this meal won't actually fill you up, if that's what you're looking for.",1.0,0vnF9En8gZfjipND_pzF4w

Selon mes recherches, c'était le Sushi Plus. En plus, seulement 13 minutes de chez moi en auto..et comme ma date Tinder a une auto et c'est lui qui m'accompagnait, c'était très bien. Il y a beaucoup de place de stationnement et le métro Acadie est à proximité pour les gens en BMW (bus, metro, walk).

Donc, nous sommes arrivé au resto, je m'attendais à quelque chose de plus grand..mais bref ce n'est pas ça l'important. Nous avons attendu un petit 3 minutes avant qu'on nous assigne une place.  

Une fois assis, on voit les ""serveurs"" passer..mais ce sont plutôt des préposés à l'eau ou bien à apporter la nourriture. Après une dizaine de minutes, je demande de l'eau. Une autre fille nous apporte un Ipad, mais sans aucune explication. Le Ipad est sale..tsé le nettoyer avant de le passer à un autre client ne ferai pas de tord. Vu que je ne connais pas ben ben les Ipad (je suis team android) et le gars avec moi aussi..on était un tout petit peu perfu quand l'app ce fermait. 

C'est ben cool de commander par Ipad dans un à volonté WELCOME TO 2018 tsé..tu peux voir ce que tu as commander comme il faut, voir l'historique, voir le prix admettons si tu prends de la boisson et faut payer en plus de ton repas..pour tout cela c'est nice. Par contre, les images de sushis ne sont pas très claires..Il faut tapper comme 2 fois pour voir ce qu'on les sushis. Aussi, pour voir mieux sur le Ipad, vous êtes casiment mieux de vous assoir côte à côte. Bref, nous avons commander...mais il fallait aller appuyer sur un autre onglet order confirmation..quelque chose de même...on a quand même été nono et attendu comme 15 minutes avant qu'on dise que c'est long...Finalement, on a pu arrêter une serveuse et lui demander..elle nous a expliqué..Bref. La nourriture est arrivé très vite..on finissait un plat et un autre arrivait. Mais figurez-vous donc que même avec la technologie, ils avaient oublié un plat de Kamikaze. 

Bref, tout était délicieux..à part le Octopus bbq...il n'était pas tendre du tout et pas trop frais au goût. 

À notre deuxième commande...on était plus capable de manger...oups...il nous restait 7 sushis on assumait de les payer et on voulait les apporter..mais personne n'est venu nous voir et le plat a été ramasser. On a pas mentionné nos 7 sushis perdus, en croyant qu'ils allaient se passer le mot et nous faire payer 7$ de plus...mais non!

The good: The seafood tofu soup had great flavor but it was seriously the smallest portion I've ever seen in any Korean restaurant.  The original bibimbap was yummy (nothing extraordinary but solid and at least normal portion size).  The chocolate lava cake was delicious.  Warm and gooey. 

The not so good: side dishes were icky.  So sad because half the fun of Korean food are the yummy side dishes.  The seafood pancake was tiny and for $9.50, so not worth it.   We are normally huge fans of seafood pancake but just so tiny here (two small silver dollar pancake size ones and at most places you get one the size of a dinner plate).

PEKING MAN in large, faux-Asian font on a bright red back drop. That's definitely a holdover from the 70s or 80s. After struggling to find an actual entrance (you see, it may be listed as being on Sheppard, but you have to turn on Ambrose to actually get to the storefront. If you're heading east and miss Ambrose, there's no chance to U-turn til Leslie, unless you want to run over city-owned flowers in the median.), we finally parked the car in front of some convenience store in the same strip mall/mini-industrial park building area. Given the PEKING MAN sign is all you can see from the main road, I don't know how other businesses can persist here. 

The moment we went past the doors, we were greeted with a motorcycle arcade machine. What is this, Chuck E. Chan? Ah ha, ha., there's a Chuck E. Cheese down the road. A waitress came up and we were promptly seated and presented with these ghastly menus, with cartoon depictions of, presumably, a Peking man in various states of labour (labour as in work, not Chinamen giving birth!).

On to the food! A family of five orders the following for dinner: Bamboo and Dried Scallop Soup, Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab, Peking Duck Special, Lobster fried in salt and pepper, and Shanghai Noodles with beef. I'll spare you the details, because there are no details. It was all bland. It was as if everything was frozen for Walt Disney's first meal after being brought back to life from his cryogenic sleep. The soup wasn't watered down, but it tasted like it was. The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges. The duck was somewhat of a saving grace. First course, slightly crispy duck skin (though not nearly crispy enough to my liking), with fine slices of duck meat, to be wrapped in rice paper. Spare yourself from attack of the living bland and eat the duck straight up without the wrapping. Second course, stir-fried duck meat. More meh. Basically, anything these guys actually cook gets turned from gold into lead.

I cracked a tooth. EXTREME pain right now. Got a Saturday ( today visit). I told the front desk BEFORE I went back that I didn't get paid until Wednesday ( a few days), and that I just paid to fix my roof so money is tight. After being examined and X rayed they explained what they could do and that my portion would be $160. They weren't sure they could even help m today as Phan's schedule was tight. I told them I could only pay $100 today. I was told by their office manager they don't do payment plans , they could try and get me some dental credit plan. I told them I didn't want to do that. It was $160 today or nothing. I told them I was unable to do that. So I came in pain , left in pain- they did nothing for me - I offered to pay my bill (around $60) as I left. They wanted to bill my insurance etc but I didn't want to hear from them again so I insisted I pay it all now because I wanted nothing to do with them ( contact me after insurance etc). . I complained  and to shut me up they wiped the bill clean. 

They are all about the money. My $100 today plus insurance ( and $60 in 3 business days) wasn't enough to help me. Forget about helping me because I was in pain - they did nothing - nothing - they wouldn't even do it for 2/3 my portion today , the rest in a few days ( as well as gouging my  insurance) 

THEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. They don't care if you hurt. They are very high tech - and I understand they need to pay off all their high tech equipment - 

My opinion : Pham sucks! Palo verde dental sucks!  

Came in pain , left in pain - they use your pain to extort money from you. It's just white collar crime - they knew exactly my finances before I even went to a room , and then after exam it was ""pay up or get out"" - the officer manager specifically said ""we do not do payment plans"". 

They wasted my one day off when I could have found someone who would help me when I am in severe pain

The location is tucked away in the office complex just east of Max's gas station on the southeast corner of 12th St. & Missouri. 

I had a 60-minute aromatherapy massage ($80). I got to pick the scent I wanted her to use and she blended it with the coconut oil to make a custom massage oil just for me! She also put some in a diffuser and near the head rest. The scent was never overpowering. It was just right! 

The massage pressure was perfectly firm. While I felt relief from the tension I had come in with, I didn't feel like I had been beat up to get there. 

Also a nice touch, she popped a roller ball in the top of the vile with whatever was left of my ""custom oil"" and I got to take it home with me for a olfactory reminder of my awesome massage.

Planning on tossing a few back? Grab a few before going in; Outside at a slot / table rum & coke - $1 (tip) / Inside bar rum & coke - $12 w/o tip.. I'm just sayin'.. I haven't been during happy hour, as it seems the place is bursting at the seems waiting for a Fire Marshall to be called. It might be best to go during that hour or so if you're trying to have more than one beverage at this place. 

Anyways, it's a dueling piano bar with two fella's who know all the bangin' hits from the 50's all the way up to today's Top 40. A patron can request a song (once one ends and / or hasn't been interrupted) and if someone in the crowd isn't pleased - he or she then has the opportunity to walk up to the the non-playing pianist, offer a cash tip of higher cash value than that placed prior and have the song changed on the spot.. keeping both the patrons and musicians on their toes. It's really an interactive environment - in the sense that the pianists continuously receive requests, talk to the crowd, with the crowd itself shootin' the breeze, minglin', singing and dancing if they know the jam being performed. If you can't see the performers, they have tv's lined up throughout the bar so you can catch a glimpse. I'm not the tallest human, so it's often I end up in somebody's armpit while they're singing their favorite track and I'm gasping for air. Kidding, I'm actually the guy who has YOU in the headlock; You'll be blissfully swept away by my beautiful renditions of Bohemian Rhapsody, I Want You To Want Me & my jam - One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer in an overtly joyous manner. 

*They also have that lady you see at all the shows.. she dances & looks like Dee from It's Always Sunny, tries to get you to boogey with her and you can't understand what she's saying, though, she sings every song on cue without a slur.  She's an interesting human who needs help, so you push her towards the random person next to you hoping they'll do something about it. Do some people observing and find em'! 

This is a place of action, sound and movement. You might get bumped or pulled to dance and sing. Good music and a giddy buzz is found at the Bar At Times Square; so be forewarned - most people here are on a good one and are trying to maintain that vibe!

I bought 2 Groupons and waited two weeks to get my pre-paid for appointment (1 set for one house 2nd set for another). #1 was scheduled for a Thurs-Fri two weeks later and house #2 the third Thurs-Fri. I got a call from Jimmy on Mon-Tues of the Thurs before House #1 was to be completed putting me off another  week (now we're in week 3).  I had two potential buyers come by that weekend to see house #1. They went with the other house on my block because of my ugly brown paint (that I had scheduled to be done)!

Finally my long-awaited for Thursday came and Jimmy showed up with two men promptly at 7:00 and gave me the trip charge, charge for baseboards, and for an extra room.  It was VERY fair.  The men did a good job... maybe an 8-9 and cleaned up well.  They had to schedule my 2nd house for Saturday (I had told Jimmy I'd need 4 full days - two for each house). He did not come out to give the men direction for house #2 on Saturday or give me the price of things the groupon didn't cover  (I had high ceilings in both houses and needed an extra room done, wall paper removed from one small wall, etc.)  

He finally came out Monday around Noon to quote prices on #2 (again reasonable) but his men were upset that he hadn't shown up either morning to give them direction.  Plus the men had some conflicts with my handyman.  The men disappeared Mon around 12:30 - they got back at 2:30ish and left by 3:30 with the RR undone and wallpaper stuck on the tub and counters (from the removal) of my bathroom. The baseboards were done poorly, paint dripping was all over the tub, counters and floors and 2nd coat was never completed.  

Jimmy told me that he'd come finish the job - said I was getting the ""best of the best.""  Because I wanted a slight color alteration (lighter) in the RR, he told me there would be a charge and a small charge for one other wall.  Once the paint had dried, I realized that Jimmy had not cut in the new color or cleaned up the wall paper and paint drippings from his men. He also didn't redo the messy baseboards.  My handymen and I were shocked by Jimmy's paint job (drips, no cutting in, unfinished baseboards). Then Jimmy called and asked me to have my handymen bring him his forgotten ladder??? What?

Botton line... Groupons appear to be LAST priority for timing and you'll be paying weeks before you get the work.  They may also send you new, untested employees (my two workers told me I was their first project with Jimmy).",0.0,5j0iuaFe8IrfOTJzkCIyLg

I called two places.  The first one did not get back to me in a timely manner.  The second one, Body Restoration, picked up on the first call!  Barbara was a joy to work with and we enjoyed a laugh as I was having a moment being the one on the other end of the transaction when I am so used to being the provider!

She dispatched Becca to my room within an hour!  Wow!  Amazing follow through.  Becca showed up on time with all her equipment and ready to work!  I enjoyed my massage very much, it was needed and I love that I did not have to leave my MGM Grand Room to receive it.  

Here is a tip, and not meant to be anything but a helpful tip....if you are a massage therapist, or in need of an advanced skill set, please tell Barbara this so she can send the right therapist.  In my booking haze, I did not mention that I needed a certain something and I did not get that with Becca.  However, Becca is a wonderful therapist with great healing energy.

So why the 2 stars?

If you have to deal with customer service or god forbid the billing department, prepare to spend most of your day if not a couple of days on hold and repeating the same issue over and over again until you finally reach one intelligent person that helps you. Their downfall is their customer service. It's probably the worst I've dealt with and I've dealt with Cox and Comcast. 

The bonus to having fiber internet is that you get L2 local phone support. As a software engineer I understand networking and computers, their L2 fiber support is great because they are knowledgeable people, not some tech moron reading a script. 

Also, never settle for their advertised prices. Don't get a contract either. I was paying $80/mo for the fiber internet only and not on a contract.

And I like his style of cooking.  So I ought to like Mesa Grill.  And in some ways, I do.  But there are also some issues.

The ambiance is bright and colorful, with high ceilings, lots of windows, and an impressive bar.  But the tables were packed in pretty tight.  Hey, I understand why.  The place was full on a Tuesday night!  If you can cram that many people into a space, and they still want to come, then it's just smart business.  But it isn't my taste.

My wife and I decided to try as many dishes as we could, so we shared a menu made up of appetizers and side dishes.  Our server was friendly and helpful, but he did not bring out the dishes in the order we requested.

Some dishes were what you might call ""just fine"":  The chopped salad, the blue corn pancake, and the double-baked potato.  The goat cheese queso fundido was better than ""just fine.""  The chile relleno and the tiger shrimp were both spectacularly good - snapping with unique flavors.  The smoked chicken quesadilla, on the other hand, was sub-par and not very flavorful.

So, Mesa is a perfectly acceptable restaurant.  But when we go to a high end, pricey restaurant we really want nothing less than five stars, and Mesa doesn't quite get there.  Lots of Vegas restaurants do get there.  So we won't be back at Mesa for a while.  Sorry, Bobby.  We'll catch you at Bar Americain next time we're in New York.",0.0,ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw

The service was pretty near perfect. The clerks make sure that everything you want is provided for you. They'll even make reservations on your behalf to nearby restaurants. The location of the the W is nearby a mall, there's also a Yardhouse, Starbucks and a Grand Luxe Cafe within walking distance too.

The W hotel boasts a pretty jam packed pool party in the summers. The pool is located on the roof with lawn chairs and circular couches placed everywhere. Not to mention that they have a 'beach'; An area that if full of sand and tents for you to lay on. You can also order food while soaking up the sun and alcohol.

The hotel rooms are clean, semi-quiet, but very small. For the price you pay to stay at this hotel, they sure give you a tiny room. But the service outshines the room so I can bear with it. The pool area becomes a club/lounge at night, and you can hear the music from your room (thump thump thump). After a while, it can get annoying.

The toiletries are straight from their in-house spa, Bliss. Flat screen in the rooms, a desk for you to do any office work on and modern-esque furniture and lighting to set the mood.

The pizza sauce is perfect. While I love a good wood fired pizza, the steel pan pizza is Madison's pizza. I mean spotted cow in the dough? It's a thicker pizza with a cheese baked onto the outside of the dough.

Had a taste and we were extremely impressed. This is a true definition of ""You can't judge a book by it's cover"". The food tasted fresh and homemade. I was so relieved that I didn't see a lot of steam when I opened the box, as that usually means the food was microwaved. 

I will say though, the online menu prices are outdated. The actual prices are a little more expensive (at least for the lasagna).

Their outdoor patio is delightful on warm summer evenings, and the inside, while dimly lit and a bit hipster-y, nevertheless feels welcoming and cozy. The menu is written with a heavy dose of sass and snark, which makes it a fun read. Who wants to order boring old chicken tenders when you can order ""Britney Spears""? I should probably look into hiring their menu writer to help me jazz up my tech reports for work.

Anyway, I've ordered many things here, and their food is usually solid. My favorite meal begins with a plate of their ""church basement pierogies."" They cook up a legit pierogie, with a soft, tender shell browned to perfection and housing a ton of delicious, fluffy, flavorful potato and cheese filling. They are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. Then I like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. Their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. I really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. Supremely delicious. I will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. So the consistency is not 100% there. But nine times out of ten, I'm graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and I'm a happy camper. And then I pass out in a carb-induced coma.

The downside here is, of course, their prices. They are pretty expensive. I recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and I had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).  So be prepared to have your wallet cry a little, but the mac and cheese should help cheer it up.",2.0,0EhPIlDozxGKpbbHRr6vZg

Well I guess it was a problem because the response I got to my request for a quote on the job was (this is a quote and the full response) ""sorry we are just too busy to get to it . thanks""  I replied ""I will remember that for future reference"" Their response came back immediately and it was (again a full quote) ""Good""

As I said in the beginning WOW!!!

How about stating something along the lines of ""We are sorry for the inconvenience but we are busy at this time of year but you can get to this in such and such a time-frame""?

I was encouraged to go again,  which I did,  yesterday with a group of 8 people.  To start,  they would not sit us because we only had 6, the other two gals were on their way. The restaurant was pretty empty,  but they stated they had other reservations.  I never saw a group of 8 come,  so. ..our table should have been available anyway.  We would have ordered many more drinks but instead we had one, two at the most.  The guy that finally decided to sit us was not very nice,  and rudely said ""come on! "" to which I responded that we weren't a bunch of cows being herd to our table. He didn't say anything.  Our server was alright,  her voice was a bit much on the ears, have you heard of voice fry? The food,  great, guacamole and queso fundido were tasty. The tacos great as expected, the mijito, though  not on the menu was well done. We came during happy hour,  but when checks came the bill didn't reflect that. The waitress seemed annoyed when we asked about it.  We are by no means a difficult or demanding group. So I am inclined to think it's an attitude issue on their part. I was  completely done with the experience when a plate load crashes on the floor. It falls from the hands of one of servers. It was literally next to us,  soooo loud,  pieces flying,  and not a word to apologize or something!? We weren't offered desert and at that point I was too bothered to stay longer.  I said bye and thank you as I walked out,  but there was no response from the staff.

The fiance´ and I have come to Okra twice now, and both times we've sat at the bar (everyone knows the bar is the best place in any restaurant). Let me just narrow down this review to our latest experience (hub's bday - and btw, I know he's not my hubs yet, but it's way easier and a lot less annoying to type, IMO).

Some highlights: the bartenders are so nice and SO talented. Their juleps are to die for!

Next, the apps: you shouldn't come here if you're not planning on getting appetizers. Just turn around and go home. The Fried Chicken Skins are unreal. Think about the best part of friend chicken, and then imagine having JUST that on a plate covered in spicy honey sauce. I die.

On to entrees: you can't go wrong with both styled of fried chicken. I always go for the Tennessee Hot because I like a little bit o' spice and the sauce is killer, but my hubs goes the Umbrian style (your regular run of the mill fried chicken) and it's equally delicious and fall-off-the-bone.

Lastly, and truly I'm saving the best for last, dessert: You have two options: you need to either go for the pie or go for the donut...

The pie is from Pie Snob (if you don't know about Pie Snob, look it up on Yelp RIGHT NOW, and then order an apple pie, and then thank me later).

The donut and pure caramel heaven. It's drenched (not drizzled) in the most delectable caramel sauce I've ever tasted, with just a pinch of sea salt to top it off. *drooling*

One pro tip before you come to Okra, since you're obviously making a reservation this very minute: it's a little hard to find. The sign is on 7th so you might be tempted to pull into the parking lot where it is, but you have to turn down Palo Verde (small side street) to get to it - it'll be on your left.",4.0,BvDI3EUPf1yJQJh-P7Uqjg

The skirt steak I ordered was wonderful and I was almost tearful when it was gone; the side of scalloped potatoes were equally amazing.  It almost tasted like there was a hint of truffle oil.

I think that they were supposed to give me some complimentary fries, but I never got any until I called up my friend to come and join me; and then I ate some of his.

SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We arrived 35minutes early for the movie, & after the movie started this man & his wife came & wanted us to move from our seats so he & his wife could sit there.
We said no!
The man started threatening us.
I got security, explained the scenario, they came  & let me say.... They asked us to move so the other couple could sit there, & since we didn't, they were offered movie tickets for there inconvenience.
The guy sat next to my husband and kept shoving himself into his space of the seat, it was either leave or this guy getting hurt!
Management gave us a hard time on getting reimbursement......
WE WERE NOT REIMBURSED OUR FULL AMOUNT!

BTW:I apologize for my lackluster previous review.  When I first discovered yelp I went for quantity, not quality.

So this place used to be Jack Straw's which was probably THE best music venue the the town has ever ""scene"".  Well its not that place anymore.  Its still worth visiting and has more than just a bar or restaurant vibe to it.  On nice sunny days the deck is beautiful.

We had a going away party for a friend today.  We made reservations for 30 for Sunday brunch.  Only place in town with a mimosa deal that would take a crowd like us.  You would think that they would maybe tell a couple of extra servers to come in at least for the hour or 2 we were there.  We had 2 servers for our group and they also had other tables.  They did well, but felt I pretty bad for the other tables.

The brunch menu was large, but mostly it was just slight variations on eggs and meat with some major exceptions.  It was a cheaply made paper menu, but the one thing that stood out ""the hangover"" which was a breakfast sandwich on a doughnut.  But, they don't serve it anymore, even though it was on this cheaply made menu.  I tasted many peoples dishes, they were good but over priced.  Everything was roughly $9 except for biscuits and gravy and french toast.  Although, the $2 mimosa's and $4 bloody mary's is hard to beat.

It is expensive, but not more expensive than the other upscale restaurants in the Palazzo/Venetian complex.  We also know this is Mr. Keller's ""bistro"" play, it has been much documented.  And I love French bistro food, my favorite kind on earth.  So 2 stars?  Here's why:

Service: At these prices you expect excellent service.  We had two tables of 8 each, next to each other, and all I can say is that the service was no better than what you would hope to receive at a Chili's.  Timing was off, smiles were rare, it took forever to deliver a glass of cranberry juice to the one person not drinking wine.  Clean-up was either too early or too late.  Just a mess.  Unacceptable at a restaurant of this rep.

Food:  Yes, pommes frites are a staple of bistros, and Bouchon is known for theirs, but the volume of fries was overwhelming.  At the end of the meal we all sat looking around and laughing at the endless piles of frites that nobody could finish.  I had a flatiron steak, asked for it medium rare, it arrived well done.  I could have sent it back, but given the service I didn't want to chance it, so chewed (and chewed and chewed) it down.  Steak quality was mediocre.  Had a endive/watercress salad that truly was nothing special.  The walnut vinaigrette did nothing to enhance the bitter endive, think it made it worse.  Ostensibly there was some Roquefort cheese in the salad, but about 4 little nibbles, added nothing to the rest of the salad - disintegrated.  I know times are tight, but this is a double digit priced salad, c'mon.  Nobody raved about their entree, in fact, I think people were expecting something special and kind of stared at what was delivered.

Wine:  A pretty fair list, and while not reasonably priced, I've seen more outrageous pricing elsewhere.  But it was predictable, mainly French, with a nice representation from the major regions, but nothing unique or intriguing.  Very safe list.  If this is a bistro there should be some more fun, and less pricey, bistro-y choices like Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux, a longer list of Provencal wines, some unique choices from Cali.  I could have put this list together in my sleep, and the sommelier and wine service was pretty sleepy and sloppy as well.

I've been here for breakfast/brunch, and I guess this is their speciality, it was super, a 4 or maybe 5 star breakfast, love that.  But for dinner?  A disappointment.  This restaurant needs an overhaul.",1.0,uPkCD4YtxhibudR2yo-YZQ

1. This is not the place to come for authentic Chinese cuisine. Abort mission if that's your goal. Go somewhere with a name that you can barely understand.

2. This is not the place to come for personalized service and attention, especially not at 2am on a weekend. You will be treated like what you probably are - a starving drunk person just as likely to skip out on your bill as you are to vomit on their floor. 

Seriously - these folks put up with a lot. A LOT. Can you imagine taking care of hundreds of drunken morons every single night for the entire weekend? It'd be like babysitting 100 children with ADHD who are also carrying loaded pistols and have an undeniable urge to hump on your white tablecloths. So I chose to cut them some slack.

3. I liken this to being the Denny's of Chinese food. It is greasy, unhealthy and oh-so-delicious. You love it while your eating it. You tell yourself it's the greatest meal you've ever had in your life and you want to marry it.

But in 15 minutes it's going to sit like a stone in your stomach and you will question every ounce of your judgment. If you can survive this brief period of remorse, your overall experience will come out on the positive.

4. On a diet? Yeah, no. Not for you.

Yes, I too have been part of the raucous crowd that convenes here late at night after a night out in the Beltline. I have slithered their noodles down my throat and I have savored the juices of their finest ginger beef. I literally can't imagine coming here for a sit down meal at any other time.

I've also come here for the lunch buffet - as take out. The place isn't quite as fun when the disco ball isn't a-glowin'. Now if you're a student, a cheapskate or a person in need of large quantities of food (as much as you can physically force into a styrofoam container) - this place is a great option come lunchtime. Just make sure you bring CASH. They get a bit ornery if you try to pay with Debit/Credit.

Pro tip: Stuff as much as you can into your styrofoam container and just hold it shut, even if it won't close naturally. You might get dirty looks, but I've never been yelled at - yet. Mmmmm, 5 pounds of Calgary's finest imitation Asian cuisine. 

Is 4 stars probably pushing it? Yes. If I could I'd give them a 3.5. But as someone else mentioned, Calgary owes these fine folks a bit of thanks for giving us an option other than late night pizza or microwaved Alphaghetti.",3.0,ebMJ9QZj8WhjbR5DrCHyZQ

Fav? Lilva Katchori - tiny nuggets of buckwheat groats and mustard seeds, turmeric, curry leaves, covered in pastry and fried. Crunchy, textural, rad. Comes with their house hot tamarind sauce - a sweet, gradually crescendoing spice experience, thin, and everything tastes better dipped in it.

Got some sort of sandwich, let's go with curry and lime pickle and chickpea spread - and damn, it was awesome. A slider by way of Punjab. Killer.

Prices are low to mid - and there are things being made here that you can't get anywhere else, plus the classics are fab - samosas, two huuuuge pastry-covered piles of fennel seed, potato, unidentifiable delish, for 3 bucks.

The very small, packed place that has the run of the mill sushi, the convert belt sushi, or the fancy schmancy type with renamed sushi rolls and a few not so common.   

In my view Kofusion is, at least this location is the fancy schmancy type and the prices to go with it.   Nonetheless they have some unique rolls and have more than just sushi.    So if you have friends who are adverse to raw seafood, they'll be able to find items such as hibachi chicken or beef, along with rice or noodle dishes.   

The service was, just okay.  For as few people there were at the time we visited, I felt the service could have been far better.  My suspicion is the kid was nursing a hangover, but he was friendly and he did get our order right.   

As with most sushi places, when the two platters of sushi rolls came to the table they presented well and certainly there was pride in the work.   The rolls were nice and tight and didn't fall apart from plate to mouth.  The fish, especially the salmon was very fresh and I liked the special sauce used on the spicy tuna.    

I would certainly come back here again, although if you've not been to the Mongolian place just up the road, I would suggest giving that a try too.  Both places are excellent.

I was embarrassed and just wanted to leave salon ASAP. The following day I found a new salon to fix my hair. They described my hair as looking like cousin it. Every stylist in the salon was astonished as to what was done to my hair. They actually stayed open late and arrived to their Christmas party late in order to fix the mess made of my hair.  The stylist took photos of before and after photos of my hair to send back to etch to ask for refund. I did this the following week as I had a lot going on with Christmas and family in town. I spoke with Emma the salon manager at etch... She informed me that they stand by their work and since she didn't see my hair in person, and since I waited a week they would not be refunding my money. I will never ever go to this salon. I strongly suggest that you don't try this salon not only do to the poor work performed but also do to the incredibly poor customer service.

This place is a complete rip-off and has the WORST customer service I have EVER come across.

We went there and asked what package we needed in order to have the interior of our new car cleaned out. (not shampooed, just the seated sprayed off and wiped) We were told to get the $39.00 VIP package, and it would take care of cleaning off the front and back seats. Not only did the wash on the outside look horrible, they barely wiped down the front seats, doors, and dash, they also didnt wipe anything in the back. I had to argue with the manager for almost 10 minutes about wiping down the back, that took him a whole 2 minutes to do, and it was still so half-assed that I had to do it myself once I took the car home. We paid $39 for what would have been the same wash as the $7 was.

I had then taken my car in for detail since I had received a detail job certificate from a friend a couple weeks prior to this fiasco, and being there are no refunds on detail jobs, I had to take it in or lose the money. So, this past weekend, it went in. They took 5 hours to detail the car. I was expecting it to take between 3-4 like they had originally told me, but, that was just the start of the frustration. I paid to have the car detailed with a clay bar to remove swirl marks and find scratches. There are now more swirl marks on my car than when it went in, not all of the wax was removed, so I had to use my microfiber cloths to remove it myself, I specifically said that I DIDNT want any armorall or leather conditioner on my interior, and to just clay bar the outside, they didnt listen to that, so I spent 30 minutes wiping greasy armorall off my interior and leather. I told the manager that I was completely dissatisfied with the job that was done, he refused to give me any money back and said I would have to bring it back for them to do the job again. I will NOT take my car back to have more damage done for another 5 hour job. I could have purchased the stuff to do the job myself in about 2 hours of time and had it done right.

First, the atmosphere is really good - I'm a sucker for bricks though so I generally like any restaurant that has brick walls.

My friend and I started with the trio of cheese (I think it was around $18 for 3).  We asked the waiter's advice as to which cheeses to choose and his reco was excellent.  Each cheese comes with its own condiment so we had a baby mozzarella with a rhubarb compote, a paresan with strawberry and another cheese which I can't remember with marmelade - fantastic!

For my main, I had the gnocchi which was really good and my friend had some kind of pasta with lemon and ricotta (she really liked it but it wasn't my thing).  Both were around $20

We wanted a little something extra so we split a trio of sorbet - bergamot, rhubarb and mango - the rhubarb was my favourite

Actually this place has been on my list for about 2 years. So even though I had to steer my husband here, and we kept looking up the road a bit, we ended up back here.

For starters the inside is nice, BUT, it kinda looks like a blacksmith vomited in there.  Someone needs to put the reigns on this tangled mess of metalwork.  There was some decorative painting along the stairs to the downstairs bathroom...kinda nice, and a soothing relaxing blue and cream palette that was quiite nice.  The noise level was loud and festive.

The appetizer dip plate Kria Polikiliea is an array of Taramosalata--a caviar and potato spread that was new to me, eggplant based dip, houmos, and Tztziki.  The serving was generous, but we had to ask for another pita.

The Quail appetizerwas delicious as my meal.  My husband had the Lamb boneless

Sean at Top Gear Motorsports recommended this shop with high confidence.  Coming from working with Sean for so many years, I was very impressed at the level of communication and high customer service I received from Joe and the family.  So far I have had the following done:

Rear calipers re-surfaced/new pads
Rear suspension components (end links, bushings, tie rods)
Front Struts
Problem solved a clunking sound (figured it out in less than an hour)
Alignment (to my own specs, which is great)

Joe always calls and explains the situation thoroughly, giving me a range of options, with absolutely no pressure.  He has never forced me to do something I didn't feel comfortable with.  He always makes sure that I leave happy and satisfied with the process.  There has never been a weird story or something that has made me feel like I was being taken advantage of, and that matters because I have a great BS meter and am a huge car guy.

Also the labor rate is very competitive and i was able to procure my own parts rather than buy from Jaguar, which has saved me thousands in $$$.

I HAVE NEVER HAD A BETTER BRUNCH EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  The White Brick Kitchen really knows what they're doing and I don't have even one solitary complaint (and, believe me, I'm very picky and thoroughly enjoy complaining when it's warranted - so I would if I could, but I honestly can't).  Allow me to regale you all with the delicious tale of my delightful brunch. 

My friend and I were fearful that we would have to wait for a table when we arrived at 10 am on a Sunday.  It was such a pleasant surprise when we were seated immediately and quickly presented with both coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming, laid-back and cozy.  I already felt very content as I sipped my OJ, little did I know that I was about to be sky rocketed from content to off-the-charts-euphoric.  It seemed as though we had only just placed our orders for the Scotch-ish Eggs when they were set before us, as if by magic. The service was so fast that it verged on ridiculous, but the quality of the food did not suffer in the least.  On paper, the Scotch-ish Eggs sound super tasty (two panko fried soft boiled eggs, hollandaise, greens, buttered baguette and potatoes), but nothing can fully prepare you for how transcendent this dish truly is.  I am awestruck by how perfectly cooked the soft-boiled eggs were in spite of the fact that they were breaded in panko and deep fried.  I have no idea how they still manage to maintain the optimal runny yolk consistency while creating such a crispy coating on the outside of the egg; it's nothing short of incredible.  Every component of the meal was outstanding - from the dressing with a subtle hint of Parmesan on the salad to the golden brown potatoes.  I can't say enough good things about this dish, you really have to try it!

I'm excited to return to The White Brick Kitchen soon to try their other dishes (if they're anything like the Scotch-ish Eggs, I am definitely in for a treat).  I loved that even though they're offering high-quality food, the prices are very reasonable.  Great spot, great staff and sublime food. You really cannot ask for more!",13.0,_5HFgadpCIaSVINVvse2Kw

I ordered the onion rings as an appetizer, & the Meatballs & Spaghetti as the main course, however, as a vegetarian, I asked for just spaghetti marinara -- no meatballs!

First out was a small salad, which comes with the entree.  It was good.  Next out were the onion rings -- about 8-10 rings of various sizes, and Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.   The onion rings were pretty greasy, as I suppose most are, so I'm not complaining, however I do expect a big stomach-ache from them at any moment -- hopefully I'll be home by then!   I do wish more places would get rid of (more of) the grease before serving onion rings, or set them down atop a diaper or something! 

The pasta course was good.  Instead of them bringing Parmesan cheese on the side, the entree came with it already atop the pasta -- fine for me, but beware, if you don't want cheese.   Also included with the pasta entree were two fresh garlic bread sticks -- they were very handy in absorbing the excess liquid in the bowl of pasta.

I was sad but not surprised to see that instead of deducting a dollar or two off the price of Meatballs & Spaghetti ($8.99) since I asked for pasta & sauce without the meatballs, I was charged full price.

My bottom line:  Decent food at an OK price & good, friendly service, but neither the casino (I don't gamble) nor the restaurant will be a 'destination' for me -- I came here because I was curious, my curiosity is now satisfied, and I don't see a reason to return.

Believe you me, I love a good shopping mall as much as the next gal, but I avoid the Eaton Centre like the plague. Oh Eaton Centre, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways:

1) Teeming with truant teenagers and tired tourists, travelling through the mall itself is a true testament to tenacity. The layout of the centre is confusing, and combined with the constant crowds, navigation can be complicated and challenging (cue applause). 

2) It is said that ""variety is the spice of life."" Consider that the Eaton Centre has 3 Aldos, 2 Bell Worlds, 2 Feet Firsts, 2 Nutrition Houses, and 2 Sunglass Huts, to name a few. Is this really necessary? Is it a secret ploy by the city of Toronto to encourage everyone to be getting proper nutrition while rocking fabulous footwear, sporting sunglasses and chatting on a cell phone? 

3) The one redeeming quality of the Eaton Centre - the prime, central location - is also, in several ways, its downfall. Parking is expensive. Hordes of people travelling to and from Dundas and Queen stations and the PATH converge here. Trying to hunt for deals isn't easy when battling major pedestrian traffic.  

4) The washrooms - if you can find one, that is - are always in high demand. High demand washrooms equate to dutty, dutty washrooms.

For decent mall shopping, Yorkdale is just a hop and a skip away by subway, and is far less congested with pretty much the same (if not better) selection of stores.",6.0,-tdsrQ3QIkGmmP2n6-DTeg

I booked this through expedia, and the Website clearly stated that there were no resort fees, just $45 total for two weeknights.  Okay, no resort fees.  So on check-in, I asked what the final rate would be.

""We can't tell you, because you booked this through expedia,"" she said.  ""They don't give us any numbers.""

Okay, all right.

Then upon checkout, they charge a $20.22 resort fee for two nights.  WTF?!  That brought the total for two nights up to $65.  Okay, so that's still a good rate.  But why deceive us?

This is an old hotel, and it shows.  It didn't disgust me.  The room was clean.  There were some small problems.  I had a problem with the shower when it suddenly went cold on me.  And for some reason, they don't put blankets on the beds, only sheets, and it took me a couple hours to figure out how to turn down the A/C.  Small things.

But hey, they had free wifi and all the cable I could consume.  I felt safe in the parking lot because they have some pretty strict guards making sure that everybody who comes into the lot has a room key.  So I used the El Cortez as home base to do business away from downtown.

My office recently relocated to King St. E, and I looked for a salon within walking distance - finally landing on McManus and Campbell in the Distillery district. I booked an appointment with Sharon McManus (one of the owners). She listened to my concerns and helped me pick a cool ash tone out of a book of samples. My hair looks amazing, and I can finally say that I am truly happy with the result!

And as an added bonus...THEY HAVE A SALON DOG. A sweet black lab named Rita who they rescued from Mexico I believe. She is a sweetheart who roams around the salon looking to be petted and will occasionally sit on your feet as you're getting your hair washed. The prices are also very fair...

*the food was excellent. I had some chips and salsa which were pretty standard. The tacos, although, were outstanding. I had one chicken and one beef. The beef was AWESOME! I am trying to eat red meat only two times per week and I may just have to have both meals be these tacos! 
*The service was great as well. I've heard people say this place is ""gay friendly"". This day and age, ""friendly"" anything is wonderful. But seriously, our server/bartender was very knowledgeable, friendly, and prompt. 

I can't wait to head back to dine on the patio and explore the menu more!",11.0,AIHzJz0AvTq0FxCLtBhOZA

Great atmosphere & great music reminiscent of the good ole high school/college days :) Some friends went to their 90s R&B/Hiphop event a few months back & enjoyed it too so go check that out! I want to come back for a flamenco show. Anyways, my 5 stars has to do with the set-up of this place. (Note: I've been here once before for post-dinner dinner since the fattie in me got hungry again. Ate their chips/guac & Sonoran dog & it was good. Get it if you like dirtydogs). 

As I was saying, the set-up is nice because the outdoor area allows you to enjoy the food while having an audible conversation, but if you're curious about the live band/DJ/show or want to just vibe with the music you can sneak inside and grab a drink by the bar. And perhaps you like what you're hearing and want to dance it off ... the dance floor is yours! Our cover charge was $5 at the door for guys/girls ($3 if purchased online), I'm not sure if that's always the case. I REALLY liked that they have these ""bleacher seats"" extended across the back wall so if you're tired from dancing or maybe you don't like to dance at all but just want to enjoy the music, you can just chill back there without having to  pay for a table or deal with all the inconveniences of a swanky club.  Big plus for all you ladies in heels who need to rest your poor little toes!

I saw all the reviews and decided to go with the Guacamole sampler.   We got an original, crab, and pineapple habanero as our choices.  Original was just regular old plain guac.  I wouldn't get that again.  Not with so many different choices to choose from.  Next, the crab didn't do it for me.  My wife liked it, though.  So if you don't like seafood in your guac like me skip the seafood options.  My favorite was the pinapple habanero.  Simply outstanding.  Next time I may opt for just 1 guac and some salsas.

My wife ordered the pork carnitas and I had the hanger steak.  Both meals were completely cooked to perfection and was more than enough food for dinner.  Heck, the guac was more than enough.

I ordered coffee and jalapeno bread pudding for dessert.  Coffee made with cinnamon and brown sugar?  Was amazing.  The bread pudding had the jalapeno taste without the bite.  Was also to do for.  I highly recommend it.

They tell you when you make the reservation that your experience will last about 2 hours.  That was spot on.  We didn't feel rushed.  Nor did we feel it was too slow.

Their policy(30 days adjustment guarantee) is great and the specialists are professional and nice. However, the managers(a man and a woman) are terrible. I deeply felt I was treated unfair and discriminated either because of my race, or because the purpose of my visit was to fix the glasses's problems.

Instead of fixing the problem of the eye glasses they provided, the male manager would prefer to spend time on getting new customers. I went to Lenscrafters to fix a problem of my new glasses and unfortunately it was a busy day for them. He said to me that he would recommend me to come another day because they were busy. Before and after he said this to me, he didn't say the same words to all other customers who needed to get a new glasses or to pick up a glasses. He quickly assigned them (many people came after me) to specialists' tables and let me wait at the shopping area for 30 minutes. Was that because I was Asian, or because he didn't taking my request(fixing the problem of the glasses) seriously? Both.

What the female manager only cared about was getting you out of there as quick as she can and getting more customers. The third time I went there to pick up an adjusted glasses, the female manager assigned me to a specialist's table. I had been waiting for 20mins at the table, which I thought it was totally ok because they were busy. However, when a specialist finally came to me and started to help me to adjust my glasses, the female manager came to talk to the specialist right away and said ""after you get this done, I want you to go to another table."" She pointed at the table where two white female customers JUST CAME 1 minute ago. That specialist hadn't even started helping me yet and I could sense that he felt awkward, too. He was nice and tried his best to adjust my glasses. During this time, the female manager came twice to our table to rush him go to another table to serve the white ladies. I ignored her and kept talking with the specialist about my glasses. I needed to get my glasses adjusted right since that was the second time to fix this problem. The female manager kept standing 1 meter away from our table and starring at us the whole time. I guess to this female manager, white customers were more important, their time was more valuable and they should not be waiting for a ""long"" time. Therefore she believed that she could rudely and frequently interrupt the service I was receiving and ask the specialist who was helping me to quickly get my part done and to run to help the white customers. If this wasn't her logic, I didn't know what her logic was.

50 Public Square
Cleveland, OH 44113

If you ever find yourself in Cleveland, you cant go without visiting the Tower City Center. This Historic land mark used to be know as the Cleveland Union Terminal and signs of its history are everywhere. 

This unique center is connected to two hotels (Ritz Carlton & Renaissance) a huge casino (Horseshoe), an 11-screen movie theater, 100 shops, 6 restaurants, and  Cleveland's mass transit system. (RTA). They also have connected walkways to Progressive Field, and Quicken Loans Arena.

The Skylight Concourse is definitely something to see; this four story (+) tall atrium overlooks the Cuyahoga river hosting a food court and cinema. Here you can grab some stir-fried veggies at Sakkio Japan, Bourbon Chicken at Kelly's Cajun Grill, or just a warm pretzel from Auntie Anne's while enjoying the scenery of  downtown Cleveland and Ohio City.

The holidays at Cleveland City Center is truly a sight to see. In December they have a 40ft tall Christmas tree with larger than life hanging mechanical ornaments, Gingerbread village, and the best thing ever, the Twigbee Shop! Here you can bring kids under 12 with their shopping list for parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles and a volunteer helps the little ones buy gifts under $10 that are pre-wrapped. 

Besides all the cool shops, you can truly just get lost in this place and enjoy the sights and sounds. Eat, drink, shop, eat, drink, shop... How can you go wrong with that. If all else fails, go blow your shopping money at the casino.

One of my favorite amenities at City Center is the subway. Cleveland's RTA rumbles below the center giving you the feel a bustling metropolis. Here you can jump the sub and go pretty much anywhere you want in the city, and the mall resembles an oldtyme train station. Just the architecture alone draws me in, I can spend an entire day meandering the halls, people watching, sipping coffee and munching on some delicious treats.

Tower City Center is a safe, clean, and fun place to take the kids, watch a movie, or blow your paycheck, just remember to get your parking ticket validated.",1.0,gnF5zBp0n-PxNtE9ORgEOA

The Shrimp Toast is OK.  Most times I have ordered this, it comes burnt.

Since it's mostly pizza places that deliver to our house, Hunan is the only non-pizza option that delivers.  If I order Kung Pao and Shrimp Toast, I easily get to the $15 minimum delivery threshold.  But, in the end, I should have just driven myself to Leetsdale or Robinson for something better.

The food is so very good, however the service and lack of regard when it is mentioned is atrocious.

If I call a business at the time they open(1130am) I would expect for someone to take the call. Not the case with this location. I have had the phone answered, been asked to hold, then proceed to wait 20 mins for the person never to pick the phone back up.  

If you advise them of multiple orders, they still pack everything together in as few boxes as possible making it hard to separate the orders. 

We call in our order due to only having 30 mins to eat.  Pre-ordered food is a blessing as it literally takes 4 mins for us to get there and pick it up.  Going in and ordering takes 25 mins just for them to prepare it, which means no time to eat.

Service: okay. When we walked in, a guy behind the counter just stared blankly at us and asked if it was dine-in and handed us menus and told us to sit where ever, so ok cool. It took about 10 minutes before the same guy came to us to approach us and ask for drink orders, and by this time, 2 other tables have sat. He was the only apparent server so I was trying to cut him slack (I work in the restaurant biz), but if you were the one who handed us menus and serve us...10 minutes is a stretch. He let my drink go empty twice, but partially my fault--I was thirsty. Didn't really come by and check if we needed anything, we eventually got what we needed ourselves by reaching onto the server's counter (sorry). There were about 5 tables in there around the time we went (6pm-6:30pm), so it wasn't that busy...service could've been better in my opinion. 

Food and Pricing: I ordered a medium bowl of pho dac biet, probably the most common pho in any pho restaurant. The portion was SMALLER than most pho restaurants I've been to, and more expensive than the other pho restaurants I've been to. It was about 10$ for a medium, and in my opinion, was NOT worth it. The broth is more on the bland side, so season well with the condiments. Probably about 6 pieces of meat in there max, so if you like a large portion of meat in your pho, don't eat here. I also ordered an order of spring rolls. They were eh, okay. They're small also compared to other restaurants, and of course, cost a little bit more than other restaurants. 

Overall: It was a whim coming in here, I probably won't be back because I live in Charlotte and was just in the area. If I was from the area, I'd probably try somewhere else also. The portion of the food just didn't match the price, you can find better pho elsewhere. Even if that means driving a little further. The service wasn't spectacular either to make up for the food.

Chick'n Pot Pie = 4/5 
I really enjoyed this one. When it arrived, it was a bit warm, which is expected since it was delivery. I bet if I had this in the restaurant it would have been hot, comforting, and perfect. It had potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, red bell pepper, beans, peas, and a nice crust. I wish it had more chick'n though. The salad had spinach, shredded beets, red bell pepper, tomatoes, cucumbers, and balsamic vinaigrette. It was definitely filling and I'd order it again.

Banana Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake = 2.5/5
This was a fancier banana bread. The size reminds me of those school safe banana bread snacks you can get from Costco. It basically tastes like that - sweet. I was disappointed with this one since I found it pricey for what reminded me of a school snack. I thought it would be a slice of cake, but it looks just like that snack. I wouldn't repurchase this again. Definitely try a different dessert.",0.0,ejOeU7d0kW6jejLcMtCaQw

The facility itself is very professional, simple and well decorated.  The rooms are very calming, clean and quiet.  The therapists themselves are very varied in their techniques and skill levels.  I have tried 5 different therapists before finally finding one who is AMAZING.  The first therapist I had was TERRIBLE and I felt like i wasted my money.  The good thing about this facility is that there are many therapists on staff so if you don't like one you then you can try another.  The other therapists were good for first timers or clients looking for a non-aggressive relaxing massage.  I enjoy high pressure deep tissue massages and I finally found an amazing therapist who I exclusively book appointments with.

I had a couple of negative experiences where I got 2 eye stys immediately after my massage.  I noticed on both occasions that there was residue black eye makeup on the face towel where I lay my head.  I don't know if the face towel was reused but I also understand that mascara and eyeliner don't wash out of white towels so I just assumed that the towels were fresh at the time.  I also did not request to have them changed because I didn't want to be rude so that was my mistake and I can't prove that the towels were reused so I won't fault them for that.  

In summary, if you have signed up for a membership then take the time to really try different therapists and find the one that is right for you. The staff are very polite and professional.  The value is great if you go for regular massages but only if you have a great therapist.",0.0,y_UnUtYHGE3kgBqZEPOOsw

Case in point, I've been here a handful of times, (and have also done some preventive maintenance myself), and they've changed my oil. All the while the person is changing your oil, they pull other parts out of the car (air filter, etc) and ask that you get them replaced, even if they've been replaced somewhere else. When I told them I got the part fixed before, they asked ""where"" in an almost confronting manner, as if they never believed it was done. Some of the service was done by them only months prior, and they acted as if they couldn't find it within their computers. Shouldn't be that hard, if whenever I decline their service that they offer me besides the oil change, they remind me the next time that I declined them the last time. I argued with the last serviceman the last time I took my jeep in for a good 15 minutes about transmission flushes. 

Stick to your guns while going here. If all you need is an oil+filter change, tell them that when you go there. Tell them that you are not interested in anything else, or that you do other maintenance measures yourself. Oil changes don't cost much, but when the salesy pitch is pulled out, you may end up spending an upwards of 300$ on something you don't really need!",0.0,gArhntoIF-9LQaJq7CC6Zw

I think you have to keep an open mind when you go to places like this, because the rawness makes it harder to fool your average carnivore.

The service here is slow. And when I say slow I mean I aged considerably while waiting for my food. I wish I could say this only happened once, but it's happened every time I've been there.

Service was very fast and staff are friendly. They close at 10 and we were staying because the show on their tv ends at 10. We hurried to get our bill but they were like, that's ok the show isn't over, feel free to stay. Like how nice is that! 

Dishes came promptly too, meaning that the dishes were hot when they arrived. Yay! 

Decor is... Well, let's just say this isn't a place you'd want to set a candle lit dinner. But I mean it's a HK diner so what were y'all expecting? 

OKAY SO THE FOOD. Cheap, and big portions! I love that they have enough toppings for my udon. Actually, they gave a lot and I'm so glad. Their fish in cream sauce on rice was great and very cheesy. My fav! Also, their pork and chicken chop with garlic sauce on rice qas great too. The sauce wasn't too strong. It was aromatic and delicious. 

But lemme tell you about the satay chicken udon I had. Oh my goodness. So many toppings and they had strips of green and red pepper to help complicate the taste. The noodles weren't oily. You could actually taste the gusto the chef put in when he was cooking this delectable dish in his wok. Oh my gosh. Definite 5/5.

And then! We had free dessert! It was my fav. I have to say, this is a very unique recipe of coconut sago and I love it. This coconut sago has taro chunks and egg. The egg was the truly unique bit because it actually made the dessert feel smoother and it made the whole thing more aromatic. Usually I despise taro with every fibre of my being but not today! My mom even said this may be the only time I did not puke at taro. 

My dinner was $9.50, came with a hot drink (I chose lemon water), a soup (I chose cream of veg but they also have Chinese soup), and if you're lucky, a dessert. What a deal, especially with the amount of food i got!

We walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!

I enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!

My minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. 

Their side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.

This restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.

The location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop. Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters, so don't look for Shan Dong!! Good service, great meal, and satisfies my cravings for Korean-Chinese cuisine.",13.0,HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA

As with other thai restaurants, they've got a spice scale (1 star = mild, 4 stars = Thai spicy), so you can customize the entree to your liking.

Not being overly into Thai/Laotian, I went with a ""safe"" selection, a stir fry in a sweet and sour based sauce.  I went with moderate spice. It was definitely a unique taste, one I would highly recommend!  I wouldn't consider it traditional fare, there were more than plenty of options, if that's your thing.

I was convinced to go in halvsies on a dessert of mainly coconut milk, rice, and cinnamon, topped with a slice of mango.  Good thing it was in season!

Brunch bread basket was better... which says a lot cuz I'm a sucker for the jalapeño cheese bread at dinner. But there's like some coffee cakes and oatmeal things and mini jalapeño muffins that were all delicious.

Admittedly, I have a tough time getting up and getting dressed on the weekends, so I'm not much of a brunch connoisseur.  That being said, their ""best brunch in town"" claims may not be that far from the truth.

I ordered the stuffed French toast, which featured two LARGE slices of sourdough bread, stuffed with mascarpone cheese, and topped with enough maple syrup, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream to put me into a sugar coma for the rest of the day.  Coming with a side of bacon, I couldn't ask for anything more.

Their brunch menu isn't extensive, but what they lack in options they make up for with pure quality, both in the ingredients they use and portion sizes they present.  My stuffed French toast left me entirely stuffed and very, very happy.

It's definitely on the pricier side ($13 for my meal, $15 for the plate my boyfriend ordered), but when I'm raving about the food to my coworkers on Monday morning, you know it's totally worth it.

Spring rolls: They have a great selection of some traditional and some really Americanized spring rolls, but nevertheless, their spring rolls are great. My grandmothers and Vietnamese restaurant-owning relatives probably wouldn't recognize half of the spring rolls they sell here, but they're tasty. My favorites? The Spicy Asian (Chinese sausage, imitation crab, sriracha, jalapeno, some sort of crunchy stick) and the Enlighten me (this one's vegetarian). 

Pho: Average. This would not be the reason to come here, although I do get it from time to time. It's not the best, it's not the worst I've ever had. The broth is so-so, unremarkable. Also, I don't get cilantro with my veggie plate, which I think is really weird.

We have had a number of issues with LA Fitness. To keep this short we were lied to about personal training contracts which set off a cascade of events.  We had personal training for a year with LA.  When that expired we went to cancel our training and were told, at the time of signing, that we could use any banked sessions after canceling.  The personal training manager at the gym on Riverview (Peter) told us this was not the case and to prevent our 16 banked sessions from expiring 30 days later we could change our contract to one session per month.  We did.  After that we could never get in with our trainer.  We would show up to discover that he was working with someone else, we would schedule times with him and then they would mysteriously fall off the schedule, and we even noticed that we were being charged for sessions with other trainers that we didn't book.  We believe that Peter was filling our trainer's schedule with new clients and pushing us off since we were on our way out. When talking to Peter he was sure to inform us of his salary and that to keep his position he needs to keep his body fat under a certain percentage.

I spoke with James T. (VP of Personal Training) and we worked out a deal.  We were refunded some of the sessions we had banked and could keep the balance without them expiring.  We had to take a few months off of lifting due to an injury so this was a great arrangement.

When we went to use the sessions we were told they had expired.  I contacted James to get them back.  After four weeks and five voice messages James never called me back.  I emailed the customer service email and they eventually called me.  They only gave me 3 sessions back.  I told them this was unacceptable as we should have had 4 and that I would not allow them to just steal the session.  I then received a call from the Regional Operations Manager for Phoenix.  He agreed to refund us for the one session that was still in dispute.

We went to the gym on Stapley/University to use our three sessions.  We were very specific about what we wanted.  All we needed at this time was help to perfect squat and deadlift form.  We were told that Joseph is the guy for that.  We scheduled a time to work with Joseph.  We showed up as scheduled and the front desk informed us that he doesn't work at that time.  We checked the schedule in the app to find out that somebody moved our appointment with Joseph from a saturday to a thursday without contacting us.  We then rescheduled a time with Joseph.

When we met Joseph for our session he very arrogently and aggressively scolded me for asking him to only help us with form. ""That's not how training works, if you're going to work out with me I'm going to make your plan and you're going to do what I say.""  We spoke with the manager and he told me we could either work out with Joseph or not, but that we would be charged for the session.  We were very specific when we scheduled the session that we did not want him to make a plan and that all we needed was help with our form.  

I chose not to challenge this because I was tired of having to speak with people in upper management to resolve issues caused in the gym and this was the third strike for LA Fitness.  We were charged the session and we will simply allow the last two sessions to go unused rather than giving LA another opportunity to disappoint us.  We have canceled our membership and will work out at a different gym moving forward.

Throughout our time at LA Fitness we have been treated as a bank for which to remove money.  The service has been terrible, we have been continually lied to, being scolded and talked down to by a person whom I paid $100 per hour to work out with was the last straw.  I will not miss LA Fitness.

And the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. Very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. We both loved the food. The khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices...tasted very beefy and rich. I needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time.

Macon Wild, the rep. who assisted us at Enterprise, helped us get into a car better than we had ever expected to get.  In a nutshell, she made it as painless as possible, and we walked out extremely happy.

   After my wife's car accident, I was dreading going through the process.  I don't like to feel pressured and obligated to buy from a sales person, especially in regards to something as big as a new car, and would rather bow out than give in.  However, Macon was awesome for us; she had an awesome personality, knew exactly what we wanted and didn't try to deviate from that into something else, and seemed to really help us and understand what we said we could afford when it came down to financing.

   If I were to be completely honest, some of the others that had tried to help seemed to put the pressure on us when we were getting down to the nitty-gritty business of financing, and I almost backed out.  If it hadn't been for Macon and her partner in crime, Alex Woodford, it may not have happened.  Those two were so awesome, patient and understanding about how I needed time to review the information and consider everything before making the final decision.  Between my hesitation and thorough research, I ended up delaying the process for about over a week or more, but because of their patience and just awesomeness all around, we walked out with a better car than I had even expected in the end.

Setting up an appointment is easy but finding an open spot to be seen is hard, so get your appointments in.

I then met Dr. Tounian whom assessed and had recommendations on work that needed to be done.  No pressure at all on what I needed and wanted.  My insurance isn't the best but they worked with me on getting the necessary work done as well.  

Now lets talk about the treatment.  The assistants and staff were nice but my duel was against Dr. Lisa Hoang (spelling?) and faith was put into her hands.  She did an excellent job and explained what she was going to do and what I might be feeling so I wasn't caught off guard.

After getting transferred from corporate after our 2 1/2 hour morning nightmare, we told our story to this location and they had our reservation on file.

""When do you close?""
""12:00""
""That's in 15 minutes...""
""If you come and the doors are locked, but it's right at 12:00, we'll let you in.""

Wait...your company screwed up, so I have to rush over there and drive like a jerk so I can make it there before you need to close up shop? Seriously?

They didn't even offer to pick us up. We were just expected to go to them after they messed up.

""I'm on my way.  We'll do our best to get there at or just after 12:00""

Didn't look like we were going to make it, so I called to beg them to wait for us

No answer.  Seriously!?

So we just drove home.  Forget it.  We'll take our business elsewhere.

I am definitely glad that I decided to go with the Best Bang for Your Buck Groupon experience for two at Gun Garage. Not only do you get to shoot more guns at this venue it seems, but it also seems more suited to novices as well. They provide you with transportation to and from the strip. The driver was nice and very conversational. 

Once we got to the gun garage all we had to do was fill out a form, show our IDs, and listen to our gun range officer and we were ready to go. Our range safety officer's name was James and he was extremely friendly and polite. He knew both of us had never shot a gun before and so he made sure he went over all of the proper steps with us more than once. Not once throughout our entire time there did we feel intimidated. He even gave us support while we were firing because we had never felt recoil before. 

In all we got to shoot A LOT of guns (9 I believe), much more than with the similarly priced deals at Battlefield Vegas. Although the whole experience only lasts about 15-20 minutes per person it felt like a really long time probably because it was our first time shooting and because of all of the adrenaline pumping. I definitely want to go back and shoot my favorite guns with more clips since I now know which ones I like. All in all though this is definitely the perfect venue for people who have never held a gun in their hands before.",0.0,U4qXdgIB7O0JLosJwwm2Ug

Although it seems they are making an attempt to be a little healthier with their new crispy chicken wrap (tortilla wrapped fried chicken with all the burger fixings on the inside). I mean the menu is by no means healthy. It is called FATburger- due to the quantity of food and the calories associated with that food. But as I watched them make our burger, I noticed they were not premade patties and they were using what seemed like ""not previously frozen- but who knows"" ground beef. Also it didn't seem like they were using binders (egg or breadcrumbs)

It's the middle of summer. Pump up your AC! Especially since your kitchen shares the bar & dining room and the majority of your dishes are HOT, never mind your clientele. ;-)

2 of the 3 stars go to:

1) Jarod: the epitome of a composed and well-conducted host. If you look up ""host"" in the dictionary, Jarod's picture should be displayed. He was bombarded every minute from our arrival to when we were eventually seated. He was calm, collected and extremely pleasant. The best part, when he came to fetch us at Central Wine he said, ""Your table is ready. Don't rush. You waited for us. We will wait for you."" *Phenomenal* 

2) Courteous Wait Staff: at no point did we receive any attitude to our hungry and impatient (did I mention over-heated?) dispositions. Instead, we were comped and sweetened with desert and smiles.

The 2 hour wait to be served a semblance of food & beverage from check-in to seating is absurd. We arrived at 7:20 and were told a couple tables had bills and should be cleared ""shortly"". A stuffy 30 min later we informed our patient host that we would be at Central Wine (a fantastically COOL waiting area). Once we were seated (around 8:20) we were greeted, a beverage and app order taken - both were served together about 12 min later. Thank goodness we had water refilled. Seriously, it had to be 81 degrees in the dining room. We ordered our entrees right away.

I have to say the ""special"" was quite tasty: salmon sashimi, seaweed, carrots, mandarin oranges and I believe some small grapefruit over brown rice. There was no way I was going to handle a steaming plate/bowl of anything in that heat. My husband was disappointed at the amount of duck in his Massaman Curry. The noodles far outweighed the 5, possibly 6, thinly sliced pieces of duck. And he was generous to share a piece with me, but once I saw how little he had I felt bad and offered it back. I tasted a bit and it tantalized the tastebuds but left much to desire ... more duck!

Perhaps Friday night is not the time to dine at Clever Koi. I would like to give it another chance, as this kind of pleasant service is hard to find anymore. I think I'll wait until October or November to tantalize my longing for their Spicy Seafood Hot Pot. Right now, I cringe at the thought of nose-planting from the heat into the spicy lava of tentacles.",2.0,273vUxZ4LRT53kiifAuwbA

The building itself is definitely beautiful, despite the corridors often being crowded. This is especially true near the entrance where the bar is set up and people tend to linger.

That Friday I drove to the location and waited for the doors to unlock so I could take care of my bothersome cavity. 

I waited. And waited. And waited. Yes, you get the point.

Big surprise, they weren't open. Nobody had given me the courtesy to call, apologize for the scheduling mistake and reschedule. So instead of booking another dentist to take care of my increasingly painful cavity, I had to wait almost another week to get into a stellar dentist who confirms their appointments ahead of time and are very friendly.

P.S. 4 days after the missed/accidental appointment I received a call/voicemail stating that they got my message and if I was interested in still obtaining their service I could call X phone #.

Ginseng 3 is located on the strip, on the 5th floor of the Quad (the former Imperial Palace). It isn't anything fancy, wasn't busy, we were seated quickly and was less expensive compared to any other sushi restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas.

At Tomo, when they ask you where you would like to sit, choose the Hibachi grill or the left (left as if you were walking in through the main door). If you sit on the right side, Tomo shares an adjacent wall with a noisy night club, and your table will thump with hip-hop music. This obviously isn't their fault for having noisy neighbors, but it can definitely hinder a first date or good conversation.

This also goes for choosing when to eat there. I recommend Friday night, before the bar crowds start rolling into the neighborhood. You'll find better parking, and it will be a quieter experience. As for the food, the sushi at Tomo is quality for the prices, but be prepared to spend a little more than usual. The presentation is beautiful, and the service is fast considering their busy Warehouse District location. I absolutely love the Indian Roll and the Sexy Girl roll, and I must mention how nice it is to have a hibachi downtown.

Walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert). It's convenient and not too crowded. Apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time. 

I ordered the Pasta Vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9.95). It was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies. However, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air. The pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor. LIke past reviewers, I also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup). Serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be). My friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. ""The anchovy flavor was great."" I also got the trio of bruschetta ($4.50) and white chocolate mousse ($2.75) to go. 

Finally, I had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when I went to check out. Fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check. Overall, I would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly.

When we arrived at around 9:30 on a Saturday morning, the restaurant was not crowded.  Even so, the service was very slow.  There seemed to be one waiter and one busboy on duty.  The waiter seated us and then vanished.  My husband finally went over to the coffee station, brought the pot  to our table and filled our empty cups.  The coffee was fair -- not great.  We eventually saw the waiter, at the back of the room talking on his cell phone.  After a wait of nearly half an hour, we were getting up to leave.  The busboy suddenly appeared and took our order.

Our meal arrived quickly.  The busboy who brought our food dropped the containers of jam onto the floor, picked them up, stacked them back in their little holder and put them onto our table.  Needless to say, we skipped the jam.  We asked repeatedly for butter for our toast & biscuit, and finally my husband headed for the kitchen to find some.  He was intercepted by the busboy, who brought butter.  By this time, our toast & biscuit were stone cold.

My veggie omelet was so greasy that I couldn't eat it.  My biscuit was obviously a pre-packaged item, which had been split and toasted on the grill in an apparent effort to make it seem fresh.

My husband's scrambled eggs and sausage were OK -- nothing special.  The bacon strips were curled up in little balls ... apparently no one in the kitchen knows how to cook bacon.  The sliced tomato was good.

The menu is enormous.  Based on our experience this morning, I would guess that most of the food is precooked, prepackaged and just heated in the microwave or otherwise warmed for service.  Icky!

If you want a delicious, fresh breakfast in Fountain Hills, our best recommendations are Sofrita on Avenue of the Fountains (great coffee, interesting fresh food, creative decor) or EuroPizza Cafe on Saguaro in Lakeside Plaza (good coffee, good fresh food, lovely view of the lake and fountain).  For bagels, try DJs on Palisades in the Safeway center.  We would suggest steering clear of Kimmie's.",3.0,GQzrkCr585I49766K7u8jw

I've stayed in many hotels and I've had horrible experiences in most of them... This time I   reluctantly decided to stay at the Flamingo. It's the oldest hotel in the area so it CAN'T be as ""good"" as the others, right? Wrong. By far the best hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. Where Trump had wonderful rooms but no casino, Flamingo came in with a wonderful room AND a Casino. Where Treasure Island had horrible service and crappy rooms, Flamingo came in with wonderful customer service and a wonderful room. My room was clean, comfortable and neat. Every person working there greeted me with a smile. And the biggest plus of all? The Flamingo let me bring my dog and let me walk her anywhere except for the casino and pool area. Plus, plus, and PLUS. From now on every time I visit Vegas I will only stay at The Flamingo. Screw the rest of these modernized barf hotels. Stay where the REAL Las Vegas history remains....  Thank you Flamingo ........and Margaritaville (for the massive hangover)... ;)",1.0,nLEqyAEm-nd9dTf1obuqcw

Turns out it's not so hot. If I'm there I either get unfriendly service or indifferent service. It's not really the most difficult food service job in the world, so skipping on the annoyed attitude or putting on a smile shouldn't be that difficult.

The food itself is fairly bland. My pita was stale but I can forgive that if the meat isn't stale. But nope, during my multiple visits I've been greeted with super stale meat to old meat. It's really disappointing to have slightly cardboard-like meat. The pickled veg and peppers are delicious though!

I will admit that I have gone on off-lunch hours. So I can understand why food may not be as fresh due to the hours I go in. But that doesn't excuse the service and I'm not too convinced  that mid-afternoon or evening food should be of that quality.

I think at one point, I was playing catch up with all the cuts of meat I had waiting for me on my plate. All of us couldn't help being a little extra gluttonous. 

And who can say no to their pineapple? 
The second time they came around with the pineapple, to my group of 6, and we were told there were only 3 pieces left at the moment... Every man for himself! Needless to say, I wanted them all..

Service was meh. We initially had reservations made for 9, and didn't actually get seated until almost 9:30. 
It wasn't even a case where they were full and couldn't accommodate - there were multiple empty tables (that seated 6). Yet, we were told to wait, as the server continued to seat others who came after us with later reservations of 9:30. 
It wasn't until we had to press them for our reservation a 3rd time, where we finally got seated - in the corner of the restaurant beside the bar. Not impressed. Not to mention there were still empty tables in the main dining. 

Quality-wise for the food was much better, in comparison to their Adelaide location. Salad bar/antipasto at this location was much smaller and bleak, but the mussels are worth mentioning.

Sunday night around 7, the restaurant is about 40% full with a couple of patio tables. We were greeted warmly and taken to the table. Interesting enough, the first thing i noticed here is the deco, very contemporary american diner setting, yeah, that's how I could describe. The dinner tables and chairs are clearly divided into two colors, beige-ish or dark chocolate-ish, somehow there were no specific color match arrangement or setting, it was a bit random to me.

While the hostess was very nice, our waitress had a I-do-not-want-to-work-on-sundays face, I think that just described enough. My entree was the butternut squash risotto. The presentation of this dish was good at a first sight, but when you look at it closely, I don't understand why the fried almost turned black brussels leaves are floating around, it was oily and tasteless. If you want to add a touch of green to the dish, maybe don't fry it as much so it would stay at green.

Our first reservation choice wasn't Sunday but it was the only time we could get in. This was my first visit to Chima and my boyfriend's second visit. We arrived right at 7:30 and waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. The restaurant was pretty easy to find and valet parking was complimentary.  We ate upstairs which I understand is less crowded than the downstairs dining area.

The restaurant was right downtown Charlotte and the decor was modern, sleek and warm. First portion of the three-course meal was the salad bar, which in my opinion is enough for a meal. I don't know if they offer that alone but it might be a good idea if they ever decide to open for lunch. It also might be appealing to those of us who can't justify spending fifty bucks there outside of restaurant week since the meal is just way too much for the average person to eat in my opinion.

The salad bar was very decadent and consisted of beef carpaccio, caprese salad, shrimp salad, a nice variety of greens, melon, soy beans, chicken salad, waldorf salad and few others items. There was also a wide variety of dressings, sauces for your meats, a couple different types of rice, three or four different soups, and bread with butter. 

After visiting the salad bar you sit down and the men come by with a variety of meats. My favorite was by far the top sirloin; second favorite was the parmesan pork tenderloin. It was pretty salty but still good. I also had the filet mignon wrapped with bacon but it was pretty fatty for a filet. I also enjoyed the flank steak and chicken. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ribs. I also had the swordfish, which I found to be a bit dry, and the lamb, which was too gamy for my liking. While we were being served the meats we had other side items being served to us. I forgot to mention the appetizer, which were doughy Parmesan rolls with a turkey dip, very good. The side items were fried bananas and some fried potato sticks, which tasted like hash browns. I personally didn't care for the fried bananas but I don't like bananas much anyway.

Believe it or not we ordered dessert. It didn't come with the meal but I wanted a little something sweet. So we ordered the crème brulee. It stole the show. We finished that off in about five minutes. Maybe the best crème brulee I have ever had. 

Service was very good and I was pleased. I enjoyed the experience but I wouldn't go back for myself. It's just way too much food and I would rather savor one entree instead of be constantly paraded with more food while I am trying to eat what I have. I would love to go back just for the salad bar and dessert though. They had a lot of other choices for dessert as well.

When I DimSum, it Ha-Gow.   Pub-Wings.  Italian - Penne Arrabiata.  Steak - NY Strip.  Sushi - California Roll...and Hakka...Chilli Chicken!

I haven't been to a Hakka place in a while.  I used to go regularly to Wok of Asia when I was assigned to a long term project in the area.  Now that I'm stationed near Hakka Bros., it was great to find this place.

As I mentioned, I like to try to the Chilli Chicken when I go to a Hakka place for the first time.  Ordered the CC and Soup special - $5.95+tax.

The Hot and Sour soup was thick and a decent portion for a combo soup.  However, though it had some heat, it didn't have any real flavour.  Added a bit of salt and that helped.

The Chilli Chicken portion was generous.  Not a lot of times that I don't finish my meal but I had to give up as I was going into a food coma!  The chicken was moist and the batter was still crispy when served.  It had nice heat with about the right amount of peppers.  The rice however was a bit of a mess as it smelled off.  The trials and tribulations of going there well after the lunch hour.  

If I had to rank my CC experience, it would be Wok of Asia first, this a close second, Asian Garden, then Hakka 77...dead last...Hakka #1.

Nonetheless, this place is a good find.  Without the Yelp App, it would have been another fast food lunch bag letdown.  Probably back there even tomorrow to try the second dish I like at Hakka...General Tso-Toe-Tow-So-or whatever (they really need to figure out a standard way to spell his name!).",6.0,i7QG1ixeuFwpemeLvmRKHA

I ordered 'carry-out' a couple of times from Autumn Court and had decent meals, so tonight I decided to get the full experience and eat in the restaurant.  The hostess (who turned out to be my waitress as well) was attentive.  Not the friendliest, but she was fine.  I guess I would've liked to see her smile, but aside from that, service was perfectly attentive.  Several other people checked on me as well (I assume the GM or owner).

I went with the egg flower soup to start and the mixed vegetable with tofu dish.  The soup was kind of bland.  I thought about sending it back, but I added a little soy sauce and kept my mouth shut... The entree was delicious... the tofu was golden brown and the perfect texture and the veggies were crisp and delicious.

This is a beautiful restaurant in the heart of Yorkville. For a Tuesday night, it was pretty busy but certainly not full. The food was not bad, not the best I've ever had but definitely above average and the service was pretty good!

I had a glass of the Pinot Grigio which I enjoyed. I notice the list of white wines was a bit smaller. There were a lot more red wine choices and most of the choices were for entire bottles. The prices were a bit on the higher side but it's a beautiful restaurant in Yorkville so that's to be expected.

I had the spinach salad which was good but I found there were too many sweet elements. The salad dressing was a strawberry vinaigrette and there were figs and dried cranberries and some sort of crispy onions and bocconcini cheese. I would have enjoyed a goats cheese or something to cut the sweetness of it. The elements were fresh tasting however. We also ordered the burrata appetizer that came with a sizable ball of burrata cheese and prosciutto on a bed of arugula. The burrata was delicious and the portion was good for the price. 

I had the gnocchi as my main, which while was filling, was a small portion on a huge plate. I saw some other dishes like the lasagna and pizzas and panzerotti and they were a lot larger. Maybe I'd go with one of those options next time. The pasta was also somewhat mediocre in my opinion, the sauce wasn't the best and the ricotta on top didn't really add much to it. 

Since we were there for a birthday, we also got a Nutella pizza to share. I love Nutella so that was good but I found the crust to be really chewy in some parts and burnt in other parts. There were also a total of 5 banana slices on the pizza and a few hazelnuts sprinkles on top. It was a nice after dinner treat but it wasn't amazing. 

The service was pretty good. The food came a bit slow but it's not a fast food restaurant so you can't expect that. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Modern and warm and stylish. The kitchen is open so you can see the pizzas being made which is really cool. 

Overall this is a nice spot for dinner. The prices are on the higher side but not outrageously so, especially for the area. It's definitely a cool, stylish place with pretty good food. The ambience is really what I'd come back for, and maybe the lasagna!",0.0,5JttwB3cfxkATSR2RmvLgA

Was in town for the Backstreet Boys concert and happened upon this place while meeting up a friend off the strip.  It's in a little strip mall next to the K-BBQ place - you can't miss it- the sign is very visible from the street.

They have a bunch of Korean beauty products as well as clothes and fashion accessories.  I mainly went crazy with the beauty products since there were a couple items I had been looking for and couldn't find online or at a K-beauty store in LA.  They also have a vast face mask selection with different brands which I loved!

The store is very bright and cute and very well curated.  The girl who was working there was very friendly and knowledgeable about all of the products which made picking stuff easier.

I give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.

Sort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.  

Personally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for Bombay Gin for example.   My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.

The food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I expected more.

I probably wouldn't go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the ""trendy place to go"" and not because the food was outstanding. 

 Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.

So of course I let them know but we still waited for 3 hours, if it was super serious, I am sure my roommate would be passed out in the lobby by then.

The doctor during the whole situation was a little off, she kept laughing for no reason when she would explain what was wrong with my roommate.

Anyways my roommate had 1 ultrasound and 2 cts. Seven hours later, waiting in the hospital, they finally gave us some results and said that they don't know what is causing the pain and shortness of breathe but you also have gastritis and a few cysts on your ovaries but thats not what causing your symptoms but here is your medicine for the other stuff.

I ordered the Croque Madame, toasted ham and cheese on brioche topped with a fried egg and mornay sauce.  The sandwich was just as you'd imagine, but the egg and mornay sauce add so much to it.  The mornay sauce was rich and velvety smooth.  The egg enhanced the sandwich the same way adding a fried egg to a cheese burger does.
It also came with pommes frites, or in english, ""french fries"", and a whole mound of them!  So much that a table of 4 could not finish them.   They were really good, maybe in the top 5 fries ever.  After all who makes French fries better than the French?  Well maybe McDonnalds... Wait, did i just compare Bouchon to McDonnalds?  Anyway they were light, crispy, and delicious.

We also ordered french beignets.  I was expecting something like the beignets in New Orleans where they are light and covered with powdered sugar.  These were a bit heavier and both resembled and tasted like cake doughnuts.  Although they were warm and probably the best cake doughnut I've ever had, it was not what i was expecting and was a bit of a let down.  I would have been fine with it, but when it was brought to the table they said, ""your doughnuts.""

We came here with 10 friends on the night before New Years Eve. While it's not the most adventurous meal of my life, it did delight me with all my favorites -- a black truffle trio, osetra caviar, foie gras, duck, Santa Barbara uni, etc... and an incredibly beautiful 3 course dessert.  It is culinary perfection in the most romantic setting. What more could you ask for? More Caviar? Well, you probably won't because their caviar portions are the most generous I've seen! Bonus points for them there. 

I could describe the food, but if you're a foodie like me, you already know the drill -- The food is good so I will not describe every dish. You get everything that is absolutely delicious, cooked to perfection, and plated beautifully.  And the ambiance, while some may say is gaudy, is very thoughtful and there is much to appreciate about it. The walled garden in one room, a beautiful welcoming bar in another, etc.... there is much to appreciate about this place and Joel Robuchon's attention to detail.

However, a few things that needed improvement or felt a little strange: 
1) One of the things I found tacky was the $15 water charge.  If you're charging over $800/person for the meal plus pairing, water charges should just be waived or just tacked onto the food charge. I see this as a terrible faux pas, especially for a three michelin star restaurant.
2) Someone was getting on-the-job training at our table. This would be OK but out of the three times I got up to use the restroom, I only found my napkin folded twice.
3) Joel Robuchon has a fantastic limo service where they pick you up in a limo to the restaurant... but it was not available during ""the holidays"" much to our large party's dismay. It would've been nice to know this when we booked our table.
4) The soft-boiled egg seemed more like a hard-boiled egg to me. It was cooked on a higher-temperature side of things.
5) The wait staff is not in sync (all plates put down at the same time, etc...) like they usually are at this level of dining.

The menu was about $600/person, and my boyfriend and I split the most basic wine pairing for $250. At that price point, it better be perfect. And it was. But perfection comes with a downside -- it's that I think Joel Robuchon played it very safe. If you're a hardcore foodie, I think you may find the menu slightly on the 'safe' side (and in that case try é by José Andrés).  But if you're here for the Vegas experience and want to try a solid 3-star menu with a fantastic ambiance, this is the place to go. Highly recommend.

This is a nice, new, cheery spot located across the street from City Hall, on the first floor of the parking garage right there. A friend and I met for a meal on a recent Friday at 11:00am and were seated right away. The menu offers up breakfast and lunch items, many of them comfort food style: chicken n waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as a Fat Elvis sandwich (French toast, Nutella, bacon, peanut butter, and strawberries).  The 'made to order' part applies to the breakfast, where you can choose a wrap, omelet, or skillet form for options that include avocado, salmon, chicken, chili, and broccoli.
I had the MTO breakfast:  3 eggs, chicken sausage, 2 slices of turkey bacon, 2 slices of regular bacon, 2 slices of Spam, mash browns, and toast.  Opting for egg whites and sourdough toast, it was a larger than normal meal for me with all of that meat.  The bacon was made just right, but the Spam wasn't cooked long enough and the turkey bacon was buried underneath the eggs and just limp. The chicken sausage was good, too.  The mash browns are a combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns and I enjoyed those very much.  I left one slice of Spam and half a slice of chicken sausage on my plate, full from all that food.  
I used my Yelp check-in offer of free Walnut Tossies when we got there.  Our server had never seen it before so she took my phone over to another waitress who cleared it with her boss.  Said boss, Ben, came over to our table and introduced himself as one of the owners.  Apparently I was the first person to use the check-in so he asked how it worked on the phone app, I showed him, and he was very happy.  I was happy with the Walnut Tossies at the end of the meal for dessert, 3 little mini-pastries of walnut and brown sugar.  
Overall, it was a good experience, especially since my friend treated me to this meal.  I don't spend $14 on breakfast on a normal basis, but I'll come back to try some of the lunch items.

During the day it is a restaurant but at night Thang Long will be transformed to a Bar and Karaoke.. also specialized in Vietnamese pop songs just in case any of you guys want to drop by.

Inside is nicely decorated with 2 set of sofa and lounger and the front and the back of the restaurant. You will find yourself surrounded by TV.. yes this little place has 6 TVs and you will have a view no matter where you sit!

Special Ha-Noi Vermicelli ($8.99)
- This is the first time I ever has this dish so I have nothing to compare to. Grilled pork belly and pork patties soaked in fish sauce with Vermicelli and various lettuce, mint leaf and basil.
- The pork belly a little hard and chewy... maybe it is not fatty enough :) (gee I don't believe I said that!)

Pho Tai Name Ve Don - Medium rare Beef & Crispy Done Lightly Fat Beef ($6.50)
- Big disappointment... I don't think I will ever order Pho again here
- Soup based is really bland..just a hint of Beef flavour in the soup and not too many other.. no star anise is used..and is not served boiling hot...
- Noodle is the package dried type...
- Beef is tough and overcooked.. Crispy done Lightly Fat Beef? don't see or taste any fat.. and is mighty chewy

Banh Cuon Thit Cha Lua -Steam Rice Roll with Pork ($6.99)
- The best dish we ordered... thinly steamed rice sheet rolled in with shredded pork and wood ear mushroom topped with fried shallots. Nicely done and bring back a lot of childhood memory....

Service here is friendly and nice. Vietnamese pop song and karaoke video accompany us while we eat our lunch....

Nice environment and only if they would work on their cooking...

This was large enough to fit our entire family of 6 adults in a frame with no issues - masks, hats, wigs, and tiaras and all! Best part of an actual booth vs a photo wall was the ability to have your photos show outside the booth for others to enjoy but you have the privacy to prep your poses for each shot without staring at the rest of the guests waiting in line or having those eating putting a damper on your diva shot! 

Two's company photbooth were very good with the kids; they were patient and were very professional and efficient in managing the booths.  They provided a couple bins of props, signs and costumes and the pictures came out beautifully with our personal touches and messages personalized on the photos.  We were given multiple options when deciding the size of the photos and we were asked how they can customize the template to reflect and match the occasion right down to the message.

Chile crusted rabbit was excellent - serving portion is manageable, plated with toasted couscous (excellent pairing) and fava beans. Rabbit was perfectly roasted and flavorful, slightly gamey.

Harry's is a combination bar/restaurant in the town of Ayrsley. Surrounding the area are trees, small office buildings and the highway, along with some local businesses and such. When you go in, there is someone to greet you. Directly in front of you is the bar along with some small seating on the left. On the right are some booths and tables for larger parties.

They have a small menu for food, but a larger menu for drinks and cocktails. I ended up ordering their burger of the day, which came with fries and one other side that I can't remember right now. The burger was big and satisfying and so were the fries, albeit a bit salty.

What surprised me was the cleanliness and the amount of service they gave us. The server checked in on us multiple times and so did the manager. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but in light of this review, I would consider it a positive aspect to mention.

THE UP-SIDE:
The food is decent and will definitely fill you up.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
This place is downright unsanitary at times.  I've witnessed the person behind the counter rub their coworker's neck (greasy curls falling all over their gloves) and then turn to make my burrito; touching my food with the same gloves.  At other times, I've watched them drag the burrito across the counter top, pulling whatever germs were there along with ""my food.""  On yet another occasion, I witnessed them pulling up a container from behind a burrito belonging to a customer in front of me.  The container dropped a bunch of dirty water onto it.  Needless to say, I watch really carefully now when they make my food.  Also, this location has a few girls working here that are damn annoying; always yelling and laughing to the point of irritation.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Good food but HIGHLY unsanitary at times.  Roll the dice...

UPDATE MONTH'S LATER:  I decided to lower my guard and go here today.  What a mistake.  I ordered the 4 crunchy tacos.  And, where every other decent Chipotle will fill each taco separately - as they indeed should - this one took it to the opposite extreme.  The girl behind the counter was lazy and indifferent. She plopped each of the salsa's on top of the shells, not in them.  By the time she was about to put the lettuce on that I had asked for, I had to stop her.  I said, ""Stop.  Please.  You've completely covered the shells.  I can't even see them any longer.  You've done nothing but make a giant mess that I have to fix up if I'm going to eat a taco that has something in it.""

She got all huffy like, ""Well, I never!""  Too bad.  If nobody tells her that her absolute laziness is making a mess of my meal, she will never change.  (And by the way - it was not busy at the time. In fact, it was nearly dead in there.  She had no good excuse.)

Did NOT expect such bad food here. My fellow diners said they had better steaks from Outback, possibly Sizzler and Cocos.

The waiters seem programmed to try to upsell everything. The only ""amazing"" food on the menu from the kitchen are the highest priced items. 

Considering how much amazing food is available in Vegas, Beso sucks some major donkey balls. The various managers are completely useless.  The manager we got to ""work"" with Chad Jahn is beyond useless. The consensus is that he's an ex-bouncer and doesn't even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant.

There seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working.  I saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing.  None of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. There were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. 

Now, onto the food. Again, WOW. It was beyond awful--once it actually came out.  Apparently our ticket got dropped TWICE by the kitchen. And, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? Uh, that'd be a no.

That's where the wonderful and awfully helpful /insert sarcasm here Chad came over. And he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn't the one trying to sooth things over with us.  Instead, we told him what we expected from our service. Comped food, a steep discount and free dessert/coffee/tea. At least he had the competency to do that, so I guess there is some hope. BUT, the best part is--he wasn't the one telling us. Our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. Isn't that a manager's job?

The waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? I think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. We made sure they were compensated for their work. As for the main tab? Aw hale naw.  Took whatever discount they gave us. Normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. Yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one.  The sad thing is? Even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out AND it wasn't good.

The one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard.

There was only one other table occupied and the waiter returned within 1 minute to ask if we knew what we wanted as the kitchen was closing in 5 mins, giving the impression that he would be just as happy if we left. Posted closing time is an early 10 pm. Unfortunately, we stayed...

I sat my reading glasses case down on the table when we arrived. When I went to pick it up to read the menu, it was practically stuck to the table. Classy, eh? After some mediocre tortilla chips and salsa, we both had the combination platter described in the previous review and guava margaritas. All of it was utterly bland, so I asked for some Tabasco. The server informed me there was no Tabasco and was walking away when I called after him asking if they had any other hot sauce instead. He grudgingly brought another very spicy sauce and spent the remainder of the evening cleaning tables, stacking chairs and generally making it clear that he wanted us out of there ASAP. I did manage to request a glass of water from him as he reached across the table mid-meal to remove our candle. The lights were very bright, so I asked another server if they could be turned down. After asking if I wanted to go to sleep (!), she turned them down just a touch, but a few minutes later our waiter turned them on full blast. By this point the place had less ambiance than your average McDonalds at 3 am. No one ever inquired if we were happy with our food (we were not). The hot sauce I'd begged for added the only taste. The 'quesadilla' was practically an empty tortilla. I know where to find much better tacos and enchiladas in Toronto for less money. The margarita was ok, but it wasn't enough to make this joint acceptable.",1.0,BKQTwMQOYkMNoElEZ1UMCA

We were a little apprehensive given some of the bad reviews I read prior to this visit so we actually booked a comped room at the Orleans as back up. We chose to pay for the Plaza because we prefer to stay downtown. I am happy to say we didn't need to use our back up room and stayed all three nights at the Plaza.

Check was a breeze even though we were there at 1pm, they had 5 people working so the line moved very quickly and since I had picked up a $2 Coors before getting in line I was fine with the wait. Robert at check in was very pleasant and since I explained my apprehension to him he worked very hard to make sure we had a good room. He really wanted to make sure we had a good floor but couldn't get us a King bed on the floor he wanted for us so I took the two queens which isn't a real big deal. I couldn't be happier with his service.

We were given a very nice room in the south tower on the 21st floor with a nice view of the strip. The room was as we remembered from our last visit. The furnishings are nice and in good shape. the bed's were comfortable but the pillows were a little lacking. The room was clean and believe me we checked thoroughly before unpacking. The room is good size for Downtown. The only things I would have liked the room to have would be a coffee maker (we brought our own instead) and a refrigerator (which is rare downtown except at the Main street Station). The floor we were on was quite and didn't smell of smoke. In fact I think in the three nights there I only saw one other person on the floor. Maid service was always prompt and thorough. She even left a couple extra waters for us each day (probably due to a nice tip every morning).

The Casino at the Plaza is ok. We played some slot machines and the electronic crap machine a lot. Drink service was good. We mainly play Blackjack though and I don't care to much for the tables there. We prefer the double deck 3/2 at the Cal. We did play one evening with some of the Girls around the dancing stage. Even though they pay 6/5 and use auto shufflers, which I hate, the girls were actually very funny and we had a good time. We did play at the craps table a few times and the dealers were all very nice and friendly.

We saw a couple of comedians at the comedy club one night. The tickets were a little overpriced for the show, even with the 2 for 1 coupon, but we had fun and didn't feel to bad about doing it. The drinks at Z bar while we waited for the show to start were great.

Island Sushi is a nice little place, prices are great and the food was very good. the fish tasted fresh and clean. The sizes were a little small but given the price I cant complain to much we just ordered more. 

Pop up Pizza is amazing especially at 1 or 2 am after drinking vodka and playing cards all night. 

The Mexican place in the food court has a great breakfast burrito.

All in all a nice trip especially since I am a rate watcher and got all three nights over the weekend with resort fee for $128 total. 

The Plaza is perfect for downtown stays. Right there for all the action but not so in the middle of it that it is crazy and loud like the D. It was nice to walk thru all of the noise and madness of Freemont on a Saturday night to come back to the Plaza and leave all of that on the other side of the street.

I had the Pad Thai with Tofu and boy was it underwhelming. The noodles were covered in an almost sickeningly sweet ""chili"" sauce.

The tofu was barely warm and pretty chewy.

The menu, and items therein, seem to be developed to appeal to broad and bland american palate. There are around 20 noodle dishes in three different categories, ""Asian"", ""Mediterranean"", and ""American"" as well as 5 sandwich dishes.

Overall strikes me as a Panera Bread trying to piggy back on fresh concepts like Chipotle's success. Probably not the most fair assessment, but we were expecting a brothy Asian noodle hangout and this was far from that.

Bottom line, Miss Lauren has a great thing going with her little, diverse bakery!",1.0,YeFT6K_CXmoBe1BbgozgSw

I can easily walk to it, sit down in one of the cozy little booths in this not-to-big-not-to-small joint, mull over exactly what I want, and never be disappointed - plus, I always get my food very quickly, so whoever is in this kitchen, keep doing what you're doing! 

If you're looking to get an appetizer with your meal, I highly recommend the pita and/or salads, which always have super tasty seasonings - they're super flavorful ways to start your meal off for sure. As for the main course, while there's a pretty decent number of options I'm addicted to their rolled pitas, which range from basic chicken and honey mustard dishes to Mediterranean-styled lamb or beef pitas, complete with special house sauces and dressings.

I rarely get their desserts, not from lack of quality but from lack of room - the food here is extremely filling, even if you split it with a friend like I often to. That said, I can testify from my occasional splurges that the desserts here are pretty darn good, so long as you're in the mood for cake. If not, there's both a frozen yogurt and an ice cream shop a block or two down the road. They're super easy to get to and find, assuming that you don't opt to order your dinner online in advance and then take it home, although I think this service is more there to allow someone to plan hours in advance, as opposed to suddenly deciding, Hey I want Aladdin's! At that point you may as well go to the restaurant, since they don't deliver.

The facial was 70$+tip. My face is usually extremely red after a facial because I have very sensitive skin, but yesterday was not bad at all. The extractions doesn't hurt compared to other places. The only cons would be that the don't extract milia around the eyes, and I would have liked a deeper extraction. Very good experience overall. I will definitely be back!

*UPDATED:
All the skin products I bought (cleanser, moisturizer, toner and essential oil) gave me really bad allergic reactions. Be careful if you have sensitive skin as a big number of Aveda products contain lavender. Lavender is NOT good for sensntive skin EVER. I had a terrible rash all over my face for 3 weeks. I could return the products but they gave me a gift card, not cash back.

It looked like it was going to be cheap + delicious arancini and italian-style sandwiches. I was rather disappointed when I actually ate it.

I love arancini. I love rice, and love rice with creaminess. And fried, crispy breading? Arancini is a delicious union of the two. Unfortunately Corrado's arancini doesn't quite measure up. Sure, they're pretty big, and the filling is actually creamy and tasty, but I don't see the point of smothering the arancini with tomato sauce as you can't taste any of the crunch or crispiness of the breading, and makes it just taste like I made rice with cream of mushroom sauce and pasta sauce. 

The sandwich wasn't anything spectacular either. I much prefer Porchetta, Club Sandwich, or even my own sandwiches. Maybe the other menu options are better. Who know's, I'd much rather spend my time and money elsewhere.",0.0,ytUUuM8gGC_qOEqkxiQ6OA

Went with a friend and we both ordered Thai Curry, which consists of veggies and tofu in the curry paste I believe.  I was in the mood for rice noodles and had that added and replaced the tofu with textured vegetable protein (TVP), along with extra spicy.  Like, hot hot. :) 

The TVP takes some getting used to.  For me personally, I liked it at the beginning but not as much at the end.  It was very different for me but the dish itself was yummy and had a light curry flavour.  Fresh peppers, onion, cabbage, etc.  The spicy was light for my taste.  It might have been the fact that I asked for them to add more stuff to the dish to make it spicy, but it kept leaking over the side onto the table.  Had to keep mopping it up with a napkin.  

For dessert I ordered vanilla bean ice cream made from coconut milk. Couldn't go without a double chocolate chip vegan cookie.  Kind of funny but I envisioned the ice cream sitting on top of the cookie and never mentioned it, but that's how it was brought to the table.  Crazy.  Like they read my mind.

My stepdaughter had the Kobe burger and asked for it to be 'medium', it was rare. My girlfriend asked for the Turkey burger, it was under cooked with a soft white center and had to be sent back to the kitchen. I had the Samburger which as a burger with bacon on it.

Now that certainly isn't the cheapest I've ever paid, but you get what you pay for! And it was a very fair price. I've never had a better pedicure than the one I got from LV Nails and Spa. I have odd shaped toenails because when I was younger I used to rip them off rather than cut them down so they grow a little weird and pedicures usually get on my nerves because my entire nail is not painted. Of course it's easily chipped and they neglect the very sides of the nail bed but not here! They have the biggest variety of nail colors in regular polish and hard gel so I had a hard time picking what I wanted but it's a good problem to have! My full set was done by Kim and I can't remember the name of the awesome lady who did my toes, but I definitely want to go to her again! Kim was really professional and sweet. Made sure to ask me if I wanted water a few times, made sure I liked the shape, made sure I liked the color. She made sure to check in with me every step of the way to ensure that I was satisfied. Same with the lady working on my pedicure, made sure to asked me about the length and the color and gave me a really nice foot massage.

I recently broke a tooth. I have no insurance and I'm only employed part time at the moment, so money is tight. I know exactly what I need is to get the tooth pulled, plain and simple.

I should have known something was up when I made the appointment here and couldn't get a straight answer regarding a price for a simple tooth extraction.

I went in and used their $39 exam/x-ray/cleaning special, got the xrays done fine then the dentist saw me. He immediately started pressing for me to get a crown that would involve a root canal, tooth shaping and the crown. I told him several times if I had the money I would get a permanent implant, but I can't afford it so how much to just pull it?

Well, then in walks the finance manager (sounds just like a car dealership) She details all the options from crowns to partials. Thousands of dollars she's quoting. I tell her how much for just pulling the damn tooth.

OK, she explains in order to quote that, since I don't have dental insurance I would have to buy a 1 year dental plan through them that would cost $95. That would entitle me to their ""discount"" procedure rate of $300 to pull the tooth. $300!!! plus the $95 plus the initial $39 and I'm looking at almost $450 to pull a simple tooth!

Well, needless to say I said no.

Even though I paid the $39 (demanded up front when I walked in) which was supposed to include a cleaning and free sonic toothbrush, I was offered and received neither. I should have demanded it, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there.

This past Saturday I had hit the West Side Market for some shopping and had brought my wife and our new work friend from India that some met at the Yelp party, Mridul.  We decided to come here because we wanted something unique, quick, and easy on the wallet.  I convinced them by showing Cara's review because the wife loves Pad Thai where I personally have never tried it.  Mridul was limited to chicken, chicken, or chicken so PP (Ha) was right down his alley.

For the appetizer we tried the PP Spring Rolls (4) and we all thought those were fantastic.  The peanut dipping sauce went perfectly with the fried chicken / veggie 'smaller version of egg rolls'.  The wife, as predictable as they come, went with the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai mild heat.  This was spot on.  Very tasty, I mean I could eat this 3 days a week for lunch.  It was weird for me to see the whole dish basically reddish orange with sprinkled peanuts and sprouts because I really couldn't tell the difference between the noodles and the carrots.....again, this is my first time here so I quickly realize what a rookie I was.  Mridul went with the Chicken Fried Rice, medium spice, with a scrambled egg inside.  This was really good too, a dish I would recommend if a rice dish is your desire.  I went with the Spicy Pork Pad Thai medium heat for 2 reasons.   1) I originally wanted the chicken but wifey beat me to it and 2) I wanted to see if there was a noticeable difference between chicken and pork, which upon tasting, there really was.

3. The staff are way more friendlier
4. Side dishes wise, I like 8oz

The restaurant was average and service was good but the real review here is for the dish i ordered.  We started off with a caprese salad and it was so good!  The buffalo mozzarella was just right and fresh.  But the memorable part was the entree.  I ordered the pancheta bucatini is it was so well balanced.  The pasta was perfect and the sauce was so good with bites of pancheta was just right.  The portion was good and i ended up finishing the whole thing and even used the bread to soak up whatever sauce was left on the plate.  I would definitely go back for that dish again.

1. The egg was cooked like a scrambled egg pancake But  the yolk wasn't cooked through (not runny yolk). This little detail was Brilliant!!

The downside was as we watched the server at the bar making it she put a toothpick in her mouth that she then put cherries on and then put in our drink. GROSS!

We started with tacos. If you show your local ID after 6 pm Mon-Fri you get up to 4 tacos at 50 cents each. YES just 50 cents each! They were by far the best part of the meal. You can pick between chicken, beef or carnitas.

I had the ""Enchiladas Suizas"" which was very good. It had Chicken, Tamatillo Sauce, Sour Cream, and Salsa. It also came with rice and beans that were full of flavor. I asked the server if it could be made with flour tortillas instead of corn but she tried arguing with me (her name was Yolanda) that Enchiladas cant be made with flour tortillas because it wont hold together. I finally said that I get them that way everywhere else and that is how I would like them. You will see by the picture I posted that they held up just fine :)  This dish cost $15.

My man had the ""Beef Fajitas"" and he ate every bit of it. He didn't like that it had corn grilled in with the veggies but he will know for next time to tell them to leave that off. This dish cost $19.

15 Word Summary: Best takeout Asian BBQ Pork, in terms of price, flavour, and quick takeout turnover     blah. (there it's 15 words)

BBQ'ed food is already legendary as is but Asian style BBQ is some sort of mythical magical food expedition that you only get to experience if you're lucky and end up in a great restaurant.

Luckily Kum Hong BBQ is one of those great restaurants. For $5.25 (CASH ONLY) you get a bed of rice with a good serving of juicy, delicious, amazing BBQ pork. In terms of price, flavour and texture, this BBQ CANNOT be beat (yes I challenge you to find a competitor!). 

However I have to say that this place really isn't much of a ""restaurant"".

Walking up from the outside, I was a little disappointed about the place - thought it would be ""outdoors"", when it's in the center of a non-descript strip mall.

But once through the automatic front doors, you're transported into a cozy wine celler at first, then through to the comfy restaurant/outdoor seating area.  Totally not what I had expected from the looks of the exterior.  

From moderately priced champagnes to ultra high end bordeaux, they have a large variety of great wines.  You can even purchase a bottle and open it on the spot for a $10 corkage fee.  

Had heard the food was good, which is why we came - and I was not disappointed.  Since it was sunday, it was mostly brunch items, but pretty much everything we tried was very tasty.  A few dishes of note:

-Buckwheat crepes: savory crepes are usually salty due to the sauce that's poured on.  Not the case here.  Crepe was soft and tender, with the chicken and mushroom going together nicely, and a light thyme creme sauce to tie it all together.  

-Croque madame: frenchy countryside comfort food.  Love me a good thick piece of bread, and boy, their pain di mie was amazing.  Thick cuts of ham and two gooey over-easy eggs to tie it all together.  Yum.

-Lobster salad croissant: There's something really good about home made pastries and bread.  No corner cutting here.  Fresh lobster meat, mixed with creamy avocado, piled on top of a fresh baked croissant.  

The kids really dug the lake view and hung around quietly watching the turtles swim around, while the adults ate and socialized.  Overall a great experience.  Highly recommended if you can stomach the drive into the heart of sSummerlin.",1.0,2dyLiu5hinn729KJIE8-7A

I realize that this probably isn't a great dish to review a Chinese place on, however this was rather disappointing. The atmosphere is comfortable and calm. [Most Chinese places I've been to are completely opposite of this] Also for a Saturday night they didn't have many people. [Saturday night is suppose to be a busy night]

Some of the issues I found:
1. The booths are quite old. If someone is sitting behind you it is very possible for them to push the booth into you. This is quite bothersome, and I had to move because of this reason. 
2. Price, it wasn't that bad. It was about $10 for an entree, nearly $2 for a drink and the meal ended up being $16-17 after tip.
3. Service: I have no complaints. I'm not very picky on service, so I have no complaints.
4. Value: For the quality, I wouldn't say the value is very high. They did give a lot of quantity.
5. The food. This is the thing that bothered me the most. The Tangerine chicken was just chicken. There weren't any vegetables to compliment or to round out the plate. The chicken was chicken battered in tangerine peels, and their batter. Each ball of chicken was [with breading] about 2-3 inches in diameter. The chicken is covered in ""brown sauce."" The cirtus flavor was only if you had a taste of the fried remains of the tangerine peel. Also, this dish was claimed to be spicy, however from the looks of it, the only spicy element was entire chiles that had been added later to the sauce. 

How could the food have been better. INAPC [I'm not a professional chief], but:
1. Balance out the dish. Add less deep fried items to the dish. I had never gotten an typical Chinese restr. dish that was deep fried and didn't have some kind of vegetables. 
2. There was NO citrus flavor. If you want the flavor you're going to have to put it in the sauce. It is nearly impossible to favor via the meat via its breading. The chemical reaction completely kills most flavroids. 
3. Don't reuse the sauce. Create a spicy sauce and crush up those peppers. Just putting them in the sauce and heating it up at the last minute won't make it spicy. Add heat to the dish and stick by it. If it says spicy on the menu it should be intended to be spicy.",0.0,ezW02HA5b_tIBZxN76wXOA

There was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?  

His response to me was ""You should have spoken up, I can't read your mind"".  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.  

So, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.  

I will never again do a food delivery at this location.  I can guarantee you I am not the only one, because often times I am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  Really?  There's nobody within 10 miles if this place that is willing to go there?  There is a reason!  Corporate needs to take a look at this franchise and consider revoking the license.

The good: we went there early so I had a chance to read their Menu thoroughly, the food was authentic Italian ""fusion"" 

THE BAD: there was only a few tables for our 530 PM seating but they seated us near the kitchen. The service was not great until my daughter arrived and ordered  wine, (I don't drink so I had to settle for mineral water while waiting for her). 

The not-so-sure: the portions of everything were tiny. After ordering  3 breads, 4 cheeses, 4 pastas, salads , meat platter, and desserts, we were still hungry. May be they cater to peopl with tiny appetite. For almost 280 bill, we were hoping for a bit more,

A very cool swing, actually. And the freshest margaritas with the most intense flavors you're sure to taste in this town, and food. It has glorious food. 

Stopped in on my way to somewhere else, was actually taking advantage of the valet parking that is oh so convenient, when I decided to stop in here to not seem like a cheater (valet requires you to eat here). I'm glad I'm honest. 

Sat down and was greeted by a pretty girl in a cute outfit who really knows her way around a bar. Inquired about all the tasty margaritas and she explained which was tart, which was sweet, mellow, etc. Super helpful stuff there. Also threw some chips and salsa in front of me that alerted the tasted buds that delicious stuff was on the way. Thanks for the heads up, sexy, salty chips!

I ended up with two different margaritas. The first was a passion fruit margarita, which was fine, don't get me wrong, but it was nothing like the next one I had. Whew. Was talking to Michelle, I think that was her name, and she recommended I try the verano de jalisco. I am a huge fan of cilantro and added to this drink it made it fresh and delicious. The unusual salt (can't remember the name) around the rim just made it all the better. Do these!

I then had a side of elotes asados and it was sooooo freaking good. The plate was piled so high I couldn't eat it all. I should have eaten it all because now I want some and I realized how much I wasted. Regret.

But, the great news is, I can go and get some more anytime I want!

So, that's all I had there, but just what I had left me drooling for more. The ambiance, the drinks, the food, they all make for one of the best, most happening places to hit Fremont in awhile!",3.0,jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w

Far from classic, Cibo takes Italian and turns it Calgarian with modern menu items, super-fresh, super local ingredients in dishes you can't help but share and hipster-turned-friendly servers willing to laugh with the guests.

Cibo is bustling with the hippest of pizza connoisseurs laughing over fig and gorgonzola pie, the trendiest of the Uptown 17th sharing smoked black cod anitpesto and the coolest of Calgary shouting ""you gotta try this!"" passing house-made olives to the next table; all this activity set firmly on the backbone of simply great food.

I received a message shortly after the review below confirming that sides will be added to orders, and a changing table will be installed. Way to go, Honest John!

Honest John's interior decorator deserves 5 stars. Love, love, the décor. The brunch menu, while not incredibly big, is also solid. I order the DIY Omelette with almost every ""topping"" option. A few of the items I chose were missing, but it took a decent amount of time to receive our food, and I was starving, so I ate it anyway. It was delicious! I expected it to come with toast or something, but it was just an omelette on a plate. For $11, that's borderline too expensive for just an omelette IMO. I also ordered a side of homefries for $3, which were equally good. Two other things...

While our server was pleasant enough, service was slow. Granted, we had a party of six, but the party of three beside us also seemed to experience excessive wait times as well.

In my 3 short months as a parent this is the first restaurant I've encountered without a changing table. Even though it's been only 3 months, we go out a LOT, so it's interesting that this is the first time this has happened. I sort of just stood there, and after a bit of thought, decided to use my portable changing pad on the entryway bench. Sorry 'bout that, but I didn't want to do it at the table, and wasn't sure what else I could do. Unfortunately, I think this means I won't be dining at HJ's until my baby Yelper is out of diapers, or I fly solo.

To gain a little bit of perspective, at silk med spa I did 2 large, 2 medium and 2 small areas. I was in and out of the place within 15-20 minutes. I'm doing the exact same body parts at my new spa and it takes 2.5 hours. The attention to detail and knowledge is simply not there. I'm making this review because I'm so sad by the amount of time wasted at silk med spa.

Tacky middle school penis jokes, unoriginal racist blacks and asian jokes, and overall poor storyline. The host is supposed to carry the show along, but instead I felt he stalled the momentum of the show. There were times I seriously wanted to shout out, ""Get on with it! We get it, they have a penis!'' 
They poorly incorporated the zombie aspect of it. They created the show around the idea that zombies are hypersexual beings and kept trying to hammer that into the show. Zombies loves sex. Zombies love sex. There, I just told you the whole show. 

I honestly couldn't understand the singing. I don't know if it's because of my seat but I had to seriously concentrate to understand what they were singing about, especially the host. Fast talking and slurred singing doesn't make for a good show. I've been to multiple musicals and shows, I've never had to concentrate so hard. The storyline was lost on me. 

The theater is a long rectangle so the seat just continually goes upward instead of outward like most theaters.

I've had excellent experiences at Prime before so I expected nothing different, however this time, this past Wednesday, I couldn't decide what was worse, the service or the food.  Maybe they were both equally bad.  My drink wasn't filled for almost 20 minutes, and I had to ask and then it took another 10 minutes for it to arrive, then I ordered another, and same story...no one asked us how our food was, the waiter was busy doing something else unfortunately and the people at the table next to us was also waiting and waiting.

The NY Strip w/Soy looked great, but I actually had to change knives from the first steak knife they gave me, to a different stronger one because the meat was so poorly preapred, it was tough and I barely ate 1/2 of it and then gave up.

The sea bass my buddy ordered was also over powered by the sauce it came with, another less than appetizing meal.  

On a positive note, Yellowtail, I would highly recommend...ate there twice this trip and both times the service and food, as usual, was flawless.

The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. 

Before I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK. 

Recently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails CPK. The peach salad was gross. The peaches were canned and then warmed, and I also saw no caramelization whatsoever. The combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. I didn't even get through half of the salad before I said forget it. My husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. The portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. My sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. She barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! They skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. 

The pricing at CPK has also become outrageous. It was almost $13 for my salad. For a salad! Does anyone else find that wrong? Considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! Pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. The service also sucks. Our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. No refilled waters, no how is everything. She was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. 

So we all have made a vow never to return to any CPK. Especially the one in the Chandler Fashion Center. Before I went vegetarian, I got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. That was a great experience.",2.0,LHdpvgOYNQj4Jo-K51Bf6g

Vapiano is a European concept Italian restaurant with a hybrid operation - somewhere between a sit-down restaurant (but no wait staff), a cafeteria/buffet (lines at various food stations), and a fast foot place (counter service).  Vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology.  Each customer gets a ""credit card"" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving.  Maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups.  And if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc.), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter.  Sort of awkward in my opinion.

Vapiano's concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page.  And while that is all well and good, two true tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment.  Vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average Italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness.

After my food was prepared, I took the tray to a nearby table.  I placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table.  Not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids?  Bugs and food - not a good combination!  So I changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables.  Maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant?  I don't know, but since I already had my food, I chose the ""least buggy"" table and finished my meal as quickly as I could.  Guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic?  The moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem.

The last table I selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material.  The drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows.  Well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals.  While pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn't much of a designer.  A simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way.  Another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!

As I left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was.  I mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this.  Had she heard it before?  Did she not care?  I paid and left.

Insects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success.  This location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes.

I give this Vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but ZERO stars for cleanliness.",4.0,hOcgrvo3yXzKkEEk9HEeYA

After a fun afternoon of day drinking my boyfriend and I decided we needed to fill our bellies with delicious pho and drunken noodles. I've been wanting to try this place because of the Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. We were greeted by the owner and a very friendly order taker (Leslie). We were sad to find out they had just run out of broth for the pho and were also out of the drunk AF noodles. However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we ended up trying a variety of other equally delicious foods.  

First up we ordered The Big Wang and it was awesome.  It came on a huge baguette and was loaded with strips of tender beef, cucumbers, a spicy (but not too spicy) Wang sauce), and Asian slaw. Side note: The Big Wang was listed as the top 11 best sandwiches you must try in Nevada. I can see why, seriously!

I wanted to try the Bang Bang Sliders and figured they would be little appetizer sized. Umm wrong, they were HUGE! Set between soft pretzel bread these sliders were overflowing with tender pulled pork, siam slaw, cukes and onions, and that tasty Wang sauce. You get 3 large sliders so plenty to take home.

Leslie recommended the Bangkok Burrito and we thought hey why not? Another excellent choice. This monstrously huge burrito came stuffed with curry chicken, chicken fat rice, and bamboo shoots. Again we could only eat about a third of it and in the take out box the rest went.  

We were brought an order of Dirty chips on the house since they were out of the Pho and Drunk AF noodles.  They were like Asian nachos, were delicious, and we ate the whole damn thing with no apologies. Leslie also brought us samples of the homemade ice cream. My boyfriend liked the cereal milk flavor the best but passion fruit was my favorite. Total bill came to $38 but we easily got 2 meals out the deal. We're definitely coming back to try the Pho and drunken noodles soon! Like as in tomorrow.

I started with the o-matcha cappuccino. It was served in a bowl. After first sip, you can tell that they use a high grade matcha. Very earthy in flavor with the sweetness of the frothed milked made it very enjoyable.

Now what to order to eat? The menu offered lots of good selection, that it was so hard for me to chose! I wanted something light and decided on the matcha unagi poke bowl. I enjoyed this dish very much. The soba noodle was nice and firm and chewy, however I wished that the noodle had more of a matcha flavor to it. 

Now for dessert, I chose the pancake platter. It is a matcha pancake soufflé served with a side of matcha ice cream, burnt matcha ice cream and whipped cream. The pancake was nice and light.

The employees were not friendly nor rude. They were just... there. However, the lady who brought out our to-go bag was really nice. Most of the ice cream flavors were ""OUT"" (written in chalk on their massive menu board). This was 2 hours before closing so that might have had something to do with it. Still, there were some flavors that I would have loved to try but was unable to and that was disappointing.

They have metal spoons for the ice cream samples - that was unique and something I've never seen before.

Sampled the Turkish Coffee and French Toast ice cream, both were yummy but the french toast won (hands down!!!).

I just realized that I wasn't offered the little ""sample"" scoop on top of my french toast ice cream. I'll be sure to ask for it when I go next time. Seems kind of odd that I have to ask though. If that's their ""thing"", they should offer it to every customer, each time ice cream is ordered. Oh well.

My husband and I also bought fries. He ordered the cheddar bacon fries - pretty tasty with lots of cheese and bacon bits and 1 side of ranch.

I ordered the chicken tenders and fries which came with 1 side of honey mustard (which tasted more like mustard with a hint of honey). A boring and safe choice and it tasted, well... boring and safe.

The fries are rather expensive for what they are though. The pictures of the pizza fries look good but the price, along with it being extra $$$ for pepperoni (wth?), I will surely pass.

I will most likely make my way back for the ice cream, but not for the fries unless I'm starving and nothing else around seems appetizing. The fries are pretty good (well, my husband's were) but they are just too expensive and they aren't anything wondrous.

Spending $22 for doctored fries, small (albeit delicious) ice cream and meh service is a bit unappealing to me.",2.0,lkPYIXIsaGfdzHttDJ6KWA

After hearing from my employer and his brother-in-law that it was not such a great place, that disappointment faded.

I decided to visit Bar Louie in early November while I was at Tempe Marketplace to watch a movie. I walked through the front door and was not greeted by either a hostess or any other employee. I traipsed toward the bar and was also not greeted by either of the two bartenders behind the bar. I continued forward and finally found a nice young lady whom I asked about seating. She retrieved a server and I requested to be sat on the patio. The patio was empty and I chose a corner table. My waiter informed me that he would be right back and would bring me a menu.

After bringing a menu back, I inquired as to whether or not there were any beer specials ongoing. I was dismayed to find out that their refrigeration system was on the fritz and they only had three beers available: New Castle Brown Ale and two run-of-the-mill, piss-poor domestics. I chose the New Castle.

After receiving my drink, I ordered from their very straightforward menu after asking the server what his personal favorite menu item was. The ""Four Tacos Plato"" with blackened fish was selected, and off went the server.

I received my food in a very timely manner and it was piping hot. Everything tasted fresh and it looked well-constructed.

My only complaint was the portion size. The tacos were listed under the ""Large Plate"" section of the menu, but the tacos themselves were quite small. They were more reminiscent of street tacos as opposed to restaurant fare. Regardless, the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable, the food was quite good and the atmosphere (at least from where I was sitting; on the outside looking in) seemed warm.

It's really a shame that for a place that serves up very decent, authentic indian cuisine, that the customer service is so deplorable. My parents and I went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm. They had pre-ordered it and arranged the pick up time. We were told to wait for 5 minutes, which we did with no problem. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, and almost 20. When it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event. The owner snidely replied, well, if you are so concerned, then why are you even ordering from us? 
Ummm, say what? 
First rule of customer service, the customer is always right. And even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you APOLOGIZE for being late. And you don't make snide comments. 
And here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. So we called the owner, Hetal, to note this error. Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. No, it was us who had placed a wrong order. My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I don't have to listen to you, I've opened restaurants before, I don't need to be told how to run it. 
UM, actually, you do. Because you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered. This is America, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. 
And it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of Charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out.

I ended up declining the hair color part for the added $$ reason, and just asked for the haircut man to make it look nice without cutting too much off. In the end he took about an inch off at the ends, no layering, no cutting to creating a style at all. I literally could have done the same thing in 5 minutes with a pair of kitchen scissors. 

To be fair I could have been a lot more aggressive to get what I wanted, i.e. exclaiming that I would not pay for extra color as it was not written in the details of the coupon, demanding that the man cut my hair into an actual style, etc, but I should not have to.

I've only had the Italian beef and cheese fries. The Italian beef tastes about as Chicago-authentic as authentic gets - so much au jus too!

Up close, it just makes me sad.

I know, I sound like a prude. But as I see another drunk young lady, teetering in ridiculous heels, valiantly chugging from a yard long plastic vessel full of some sugary sweet, booze-filled drink, I have to wonder if she is really having fun or if she just thinks she is.

Another thing that is particularly depressing to me is the women who are handing out cards for ""dates"" that you can have in your hotel room in 10 minutes.  Do they understand what they are doing to these other women, who are someone's sister, daughter, mother?

The lady wasn't specify the size and the place to be engraved, so a few minutes after we walked from the store, we returned and came back to give the specific detail (They really seems not to care). So the lady said it will be in large size and we agree that it's going to be engraved from left to center on the bottom left. 

The next day I got a phone call 9.30am, checking the spelling of what I wrote, because another lady who was going to do the engrave for my item, cannot differentiate a ""T"" and ""F"" , even though clearly, the F will consist of 2 lines. Ok fine. 

I picked up in the evening to find out that the engrave words are on the bottom center to right and it was so small. It was something not apparent and not what I was expecting, considering that I paid $66 for a chopping board. I was very disappointed. Funny thing is that the lady was persistent that she followed the order written on the note from her co-worker and then showed it to me that it clearly said ""left to center"".

Pros:
Friendliness of the staff! From check in to check out, they were unbelievably accommodating and friendly. 

Amenities in the room. Full kitchen (which is the reason we booked there to begin with. A lot of places in Vegas do not have a kitchen). It had a sink, fridge, toaster, stove top, tea kettle, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, and cabinets. As a nice touch, they had Rio Blend coffee in the room. Maybe because of the 2016 Olympics coming up? Also had paper coffee cups, sweeteners, creamer cups, and stirring sticks. Due to county regulations, they are not allowed to keep plates, silverware, etc in the room but will bring them to your room if needed. 

They also included an iron, ironing board, blow dryer, light up mirror, bathrobe, and plenty of fluffy towels. 

The bathroom has a TV inside the mirror. Didn't use it but interesting touch. Spa tub and separate shower. Marble counters and floors. Water heated up VERY quickly. 

The pillows!!! Oh the pillows! I have to find the Downrite brand online or in Macy's or something because they were divine. Beds were comfy too. 

Our room even had a DOORBELL on it instead of the bellboy knocking, he rang a door bell! LOL

The AC was amazing and cooled the room quickly and kept it cool. 

Very quiet. We never once heard any other guests. All the appliances in the room were quiet as well. 

The elevators. Fast. Ya know how some hotels you stand there forever waiting on the elevator? Not here. I timed it. It took 13 seconds to get from the 39th floor to the lobby. Unreal. 

The ice machines are in their own little rooms in the hallways so you don't have to listen to someone getting ice in the middle of the night. 

It is right across from a huge mall. Lots of shops and a large food court. 

Cons:

The train. Yes, you read that correctly. There was a train that ran behind the hotel where our room was facing that ran every couple of hours throughout the night and woke us up each time. As it came up to an intersection, it would blow its horn over and over. But this is where the nice staff came in handy. They were more than willing and helpful to move us to a room facing The Strip in exchange for a small extra fee because it was a room facing The Strip. We could still hear the train in the distance but not enough to wake us up. We only heard it before heading to bed. 

Valet. Yes, I know that valet was supposed to be bougie and helpful, however, we found it bothersome. It's just easier to have access to our car when needed. On the other hand there was a relatively short wait time so it wasn't too bad. However, that depends on your timing. Some times of the day were very busy. 

Internet. It was a bit slow. So if you are someone there on business who needs fast internet for work, this may become an issue. 

Sleeper sofa. We pulled out the sleep sofa that our original room included. For a 5 star place, there should be a nicer one. It was just your run of the mill, feel every spring, mattress. 

No casino. For me personally, this was not a problem but if you going to Vegas to gamble, this may be an issue for you. 

Not on The Strip. The only reason this is a issue is because of the heat. If you want to go out and walk The Strip, you also have to add to that walk because you have to get from the hotel to Las Vegas Blvd. It's not too far but the heat is what does it. 

I may not agree on his politics but his hotel was top notch. Would recommend.",4.0,wLX9LOdGSldk9jAi-ty7tQ

My husband walks in at the same time and asks, ""Did you find any?  Have you been helped?""  And my response is ""NO!""  I understand that you are going to close in 15 mins. And that you have lives to live. However, I am a customer, in the establishment that pays you to sell their product. And today, you did a VERY BAD job. We walked out.

Day one part for my car did not arrive on time. Day 2, Steve the location manager went himself in the morning of day 2 to get the headgasket.

I think I started another review like this already, but really -- I stopped in here because the hubs and I were checking out of the Golden Nugget, and it's right past one of their checkin/out desks.  Looks super fancy.  I thought everything would be crazy pricey (super cute + Vegas = $$$ to me), but surprisingly, their ginormous cupcakes were just $3!! And their chocolate-dipped macaroons (or sans-chocolate, same price) were ... shoot, incredibly affordable is all I remember.  AND, it's not like these macaroons were *just* dipped in chocolate either -- I saved these as a treat for myself, rather than sharing them with my friends who were celebrating the big 3-0 (I'm a fab friend, what can I say), and it was like a truffle was stuck to the bottom of those macaroons, talk about a delightful surprise!  Honestly, I don't have much experience with macaroons other than visual, but the softness and coconuttiness (not too much) were very appealing.  And back to those cupcakes -- huge.  Delicious. I got one red velvet for one friend, who shared a bite with me -- moist, tasty, cream cheese frosting was perfect.  I carted around the other two cupcakes for the rest of the trip, and only got to sample the chocolate-chocolate -- also delish.

So we started with the bone marrow and the pâté.  Oh, bone marrow, where have you been all my life when you could have been clogging my arteries?  The waiter (Michael, who was AWESOME) showed me how to smear it on my bread.  Yum.  The pâté was tasty -- but eclipsed by the marrow.  I had a Sazerac and my wife had a Moscow Mule to accompany -- both top notch jobs by the bartender.

The main courses -- a Lamb sirloin for the lady, and a kilo of mussels and truffle frites for me.  Both were amazing, fantastic, to die for good.  The mussels were steamed in wine, mustard, and garlic with some ham thrown in for good measure.  The frites were served in a cone that had some decidedly non-Euclidean properties to it -- no matter how many we ate, there were still more in the cone.

Listen to the wait staff on the wine and/or beer pairings.  You're welcome.

We didn't eat dessert.  Because we were full to bursting on the rest.  The portions are generous, so go hungry.

The first visit was a little bumpy; however they had just opened a few days before so it was expected to have some rough spots. The food was on pointe and their craft  beer game was solid during the first visit, so we decided to give them another go round.  Service was way better (since it was a Tuesday and kind of slow, our waiter was very attentive).  Again, the food (for the most part) was ah-mazing.  Beer selection has a good rotation.  I was sad they didn't have the witbier from last week, however the PB Porter from Peoria Artisan was a welcome addition.  

Pros:
-PB&J Burger (I swear, try it ala mode - it's soooo good! They must think I'm a weirdo though.  Our waitress said the kitchen staff was confused by my request )
-The fried chicken - enough to feed 2 people and the best we've had!
-The sloppy corn bread- divine
- The Divolono (sp?) Pizza - spicy with a hint of honey sweetness
-CRAFT BEER!!!!

Cons:
-The pretzels - 3 small pretzel ""sticks"" - maybe 4 would be a better number and they just seemed very small.  Both of our orders also were cold.

-Our side of fries came in a large dish, but there were so few that it looked like we got someone's leftovers.  They were hot though, and my 6 year old seemed to like them

Finally, the spicy chicken sandwiches. I ordered the sauces on the side (because I'm really picky and don't like many sauces) so I can't speak for those however the sandwiches were good with some lettuce and tomato. The chicken breast was nice and crispy.

My fiance had the three way salad. He said ""one of them had old, wilty, red lettuce"".

Second was the corn dog which were ""greasy but decent"".

I've eaten dim sum around the world.  Kwan's food is good but after having gone there a dozen times and repeatedly having the same bad experience in terms of customer service, I'm so turned off.  While there is an abundance of wait staff, it is impossible to get anyone's attention once seated, to even put in your order or ask for anything else.  No one has clearly ever stressed to the staff the importance of being attentive, welcoming and polite, either.  And while their prices are not through the roof, they aren't exactly a bargain either.  $18 for Chinese broccoli with ginger??!!  Given that they price some dishes so ridiculously high, one would think they would bring them pronto so that the diner doesn't have enough time to brood over or process just how expensive the dish actually is.
There are other options for high end dim sums, Lai Wah Heen being one and Crown Princess on Bay being another.  The latter is fancier, has a more extensive and exotic menu and is more affordable than Kwan.  More importantly, their staff is phenomenal.  I'd make the trek there rather than to Kwan's.

The bento came out and the beef was good. They forgot to bring out the rice and when they did it was a little on the dry side.

I am sad to see a local spot gone but the family that owns this place is cute. I feel like they just opened a place to serve food they make at home.

It has a typical Vietnamese menu minus the curries. I did however see they offered a beef stew with bread yum.

Basically the food was good, the place was clean, and the service was polite. They could do to stop by the tables more often except to drop food off but I enjoyed all of the staff I encountered. Very sweet and friendly. 

We tried their combo pho $8x 2, a ban mi dac biet $3 and some change, and their spring rolls $3. All came out to $24 and some change. We were stuffed. It was a bargain IMO.

I really liked their sandwich. Their bread was hot, fresh, and crunchy. I've never had one like that. I want to say they didn't put the patte part. I have to say I didn't miss it, and I've been eating those sandwiches since my childhood. At first it looked like they skimped on meat but it was perfect. I loved it.

Their pho was good. It was a good size with a large amount of meat. The broth was good, the noodles were cooked just right, and it was served super hot. The bowl looked below average in size but it was just the right amount. I finished the whole bowl and the broth. 

Their spring rolls were good. The dipping sauce was good. I enjoyed them. 

I have to say for a newer place I thought they did a great job. If they are reading and I could help them improve I'd say to offer straws for their water, get a napkin dispenser for the table if they don't plan to walk by too much, and lastly take their service to the next level.

The lemon piece served with them was dried out. The hummus, though tasty, was VERY thick!  Almost like cutting into a soft cheese - not spreadable.  We asked for some oil to add to it and felt that that was really a just so-so solution.  I doubt seriously that it was freshly made - thinking it had been sitting around for a while.  
Our pastitsio was ok - not very hot when served though, my guess is that it was microwaved.  Our pasta (ziti)  was the worst we've had in a restaurant ever - in that it was SO overdone.  Normally, if a dish isn't perfect , we will not ask for a replacement, but this was luke warm and SO mushy and starchy and tasteless. The server explained something that I really didn't want to know - that the pasta is precooked at the beginning of the day and then reheated ! - not cooked to order.  Our server was accomodating, but the whole experience was much less than wonderful.  While we expect ethnic music in an ethnic restaurant, theirs was so loud that after a couple times around the play list we were really quite ready to leave and had our 2nd plate of ziti (only slightly less mushy) packaged to go.  a big disappointment - glad we had a groupon.  BUT - it turns out that our server's insistance that the groupon required us to order two entrees (rather than the mix of soup/salad and one entree we'd planned to order) was NOT true. We didn't have the groupon with us - only on my phone and I didn't look closely at it until I got home and looked at it more closely on my lap  top. SO that less than hot, overdone ziti was the dish that we actually didn't plan to order - but we had to, and that pushed our lunch order over the $30 limit of the groupon -- just an overall bad lunch experience - after a previous lunch there which was much better.",1.0,vTNSJAJJmdymOhPu3sqfFA

   I am sorry we got off on the wrong foot... I was all wrong about you! I am so happy that I decided to give you a second chance, and you beyond redeemed yourself! If you read my first review I didn't have such a stellar experience, It wasn't bad per say but it wasn't what I was expecting! So, I was hoping that the second time around would be better and it was!

This time around we went and ordered another bottle of my now favorite wine Sexual Chocolate, it's a Syrah - Zinfandel blend and it's frankly to die for. The bottle runs around $65.00 and they offer it by the glass as well at I believe $16.00.  This go around we decided to order an assortment of their appetizers, and I was frankly blown away by nearly all of them. The only one I wouldn't order again would be the Spicy Tuna Pops. The tuna itself was amazing, super fresh and really flavorful. The waffle cone that it arrived in didn't exactly compliment the fish. 

Other items that we ordered and LOVED were the dozen oysters, we got an assortment of the oysters they had that particular day and they were fresh and this time around there wasn't a trace of shell in any of the oysters! WOOHOO!

The Crispy Cuttlefish was one of my fav items that evening - The only way to describe it is that it is very similar to calamari but frankly it's better than calamari. It doesn't have that rubbery texture to it and it was fried to perfection and the lemon aioli was the perfect compliment to it. 

Cuttlefish's take on a wedge salad is what dreams are made of! I love wedge salads but I usually am not a huge fan of the iceberg lettuce since it really has zero taste or nutritional value to it. The bibb lettuce was a welcome change of pace and the crispy pancetta, and avocado was a nice  addition. 

The pork  belly, the Carlsbad Mussels, Shrimp and grits I could just go on and on! Had the opportunity to meet Joey one of the owners who was very friendly, and I was really impressed when I learned that he actually cooks in the kitchen there. I love that he is a hands on owner and it shows that he has a real investment in the establishment!

The only difference is that they have live cooking stations for noodles and grilling meats. They also had freshly grilled half lobsters and you could ask for more than one. Drinks are self served so there's a drink station filled with a pop station and a fridge with bottled juice and water. My favourite stations were the chocolate fondue and waffle station.

If you're looking for yummy, cheap food in massive quantities, look no further. Mickies is the place to be.

The pancakes are monstrous!! But they are truthfully delicious. In fact I've been engaging in a scandalous love affair with their chocolate chip pancakes...(and sometimes, though less often, their strawberry pancake)...for the past few months. The relationship is a tough one that's cost me normal blood sugar levels and more importantly, friendships. Eating off the plate of my dear comrades who had themselves ordered the pancake has ultimately led to bitter disputes that never end smoothly. Ah well, the contentment I extract from each forkful of syrup-drenched, melty-chocolate-chip-covered pancake makes up for all the troubles. 

On a more savory note, the corned beef hash is also quite fantastic. Get it alongside 2 sunny up eggs and rye toast and badda-bing, badda-bomb, you've got one killer breakfast for yourself. 

One of my other go-to orders is the steak and eggs with hash browns and onions. Wowza! Now I know I wasn't exactly around in the '50s or nothin, but talk about old school diner food done wayyyy right.

So in addition to all that, our toilet doesn't flush and runs constantly. The beds feel like cardboard. Then the noise outside is insanely loud!!! It's 12pm and the music is still thumping.

Till I need Internet service, I switched to Earth Link that was supplied by Road Runners eventually Time Warner's Cable.  Thanks for clarify that is not same as Time Warners Bro.
I need to calm myself down every time to call Time Warner Cable's service especially talking about their price and billin.  The worst I've come across in the country. I live in east and west coast.  I suffered  many times before I say it.  Besides, it takes us time to write this.
TWC, or Road Runners ( they were the same ) was the supplier of cable internet for Earth Link (I was told later) when I called for connection problem.  TWC convinced me to change  from Earth Link to TWC.  I refused the first year for TWC's bad  business integrity.  Few years later, I had no choice as the price went up again.  So I switched to TWC. The second year, it went up that understood, after promotion.  To save trouble of payment, I set up auto- pay, this year it went up again.  I called to understand the reason.  Their customer service was so rude with a prima donna attitude.  She even insulted me over the phone as I didn't want all the services. Since I stayed for a week of less each month, it's unjustified for me to pay close to $100.  I simply kept my expenses but the service reduced to 1/10 of the speed that I had.  I'm looking for another provider if there is. 
For all these years, I've seen more adverse comments than favorable comments to TWC.  Most business respect prestige customers or those stay with them for years. But not TWC.  They believe customers can't live without them in Charlotte.  That's why I've seen salesmen knocking at our doors every season like the 50s to look for new customers.
I'm sure if TWC's upper management can make a change to their customer services or change their prima donna attitude, I'm sure they will not loss customers.
Anyway, sorry for my long comments.  I still like Dish Network, perhaps, I will go back to put my dish up.",11.0,splaIyz_8E0-hqNIHe2GLQ

They also offer a hot chilli sauce to zip it up another notch if spicy is to your liking. 

The restaurant is simple yet decor is clean and comfortable. The husband and wife team do also special Taiwanese cookies which we got to sample the pineapple filled ones which were a pleasant finish to a big bowl of soup. 

Service was friendly and we were the only ones in the restaurant on the visit so we had more personal explanations of their culture with some jokes thrown in.

Price wise it's extremely inexpensive at around $10 a bowl. The crew that came left with full tummies and content satisfaction.

Not only did I trust everyone wearing a VBS shirt - I really ended up liking each one of them. And finally, my wife is a perfectionist. Their work pleased her which is close to impossible!

You can eat and get beyond full for two for about 20 bucks and that is a huge plus for me.

There was not apology given to us by the staff or hotel to try and make good on a concert we specifically paid for. I was pretty disappointed in the Vegas attitude.

The service is quite personal and yet uncumbersome.  The space is plainly lit and is no bigger than a small chapel on Capri, yet it is intimate and warm.

The gnocci, the carbonara, the soup.  You cannot make an error ordering from their carefully chosen menu items.  But you might be amazed that freshness tastes much different than what you have become used to at the many chain Italian restaurants you somehow keep patronizing.

They host birthday parties, offer party favor options that are out of the norm and they even have a photo booth in the store! It's a fun and exciting shop! Check it out if you haven't been! There are also two other cool stores next door. Frances is a women's men's and children's store that carries shoes, jewelry, bath and body products, gifts, toys and clothing. It is owned by the same owner as Smeeks and it is also a great store! Stinkweed's is next door too. It's a record store with a lot of soul!",0.0,_9YVGY6XQOxp1MHjagWiwA

OK that was our bad,  we told them that they couldn't do that and they stopped. We ordered another round of shrimp and the manager decided to come over to our table and instead of politely notifying us that there is no sharing, it seemed like she wanted to announce it to the other tables around us and remind us that it says that on the menu. We offered to pay for a side of shrimp if it was an issue,  but the manager just said it was OK and walked away... The conversation between the manager and the elderly man after that was not professional and was indicative of someone who did not have enough training to diffuse a guest situation. 

Side note: if you and any other party members order their all you can eat shrimp option you still can't share. I made sure to clearly ask the server this question to be sure there was no misunderstanding. 

This rating is not because of the ""no sharing"" rule, I now take issue with the Outback Steakhouse slogan. The food was decent, but the situation should have been handled better. I have had ample customer and guest service training to know that much. I believe more training is necessary for both management and staff.

Having lived in the valley for most of my life I appreciate the sentimentality.  

BUT!  It is important to separate nostalgia from reality, especially when others rely on your opinion when making dinner plans.

I've lived in the Valley for a good long time- more than 40 years.  I've been to Jordan's more times than I can count.  

As a child, this was one of many local Mexican food restaurants we visited- others being El Maya, Don Jose's, Rosa's, Rosita's, George's Ole, and others.  As an adult, part of my enjoyment was the old-fashioned, retro atmosphere- the genuine Naugahyde seats, dark wrought iron, old-school environment.  I was even OK with the smooth taco sauce in lieu of chopped and chunky salsa.  I tend to stick with the old-school combo plate- taco, enchilada, tostada type combos when I visit.

My last two visits have occurred in the last year- most recently in November.  The experiences were almost identical- disappointing.  It was as if someone in the kitchen had just given up.  The taco meat was not really seasoned, very bland, and the shell tasted as if they went and picked up a package at the grocery instead of making their own.  The enchilada was rather oily.  Food was warm, not hot.  Service was friendly but scarce- my drink sat empty more than once.

The visit in November is likely my last.  I drive by this location at least 3 times a week, and remember wistfully the days when the the food was piping hot, shredded beef well seasoned and the entire taco fresh out of the cooker- crispy and delicious.   There are too many good Mexican food places in town, and even for the memories that walking into this places conjures up, I cannot see myself coming back anytime soon.  I'll keep my eyes open for an upturn in Yelp reviews, particularly from those who are trying it for the first time.

As another reviewer said- be forewarned.  You run a great risk of being disappointed.",10.0,KUTTubStiNYigQpi3L9-3w

The evening started out well enough - we didn't realize we'd need a reservation but was able to sit at one of the high tops near the bar.  The table was wobbly, but the server (busboy?) immediately got down on his knees and readjusted the ends for us.

We started out with the cheddar bites.  They were mini, dense and rather not great.  Its almost like a failure attempt at recreating Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits.  The shrimp and grits were decent, but a far cry from NOLA.  The meat and potatoes were decent, but really average if that.  The duck fat fries were actually pretty good and the only thing we all agreed was tasty.  Too bad the waiter took it away before we were done while talking to another server so we couldn't even protest.

The reasons for the 2 stars - the dishes are creative, the menu is mysterious (which is good and bad), and there was such hope there.  These were the kinds of dishes that you might see on Master Chef or Hell's Kitchen.  But they wouldn't be winners by any means.  

The place is kept COLD.  We were near the vents, but still, by the time our food reached our table, they were lukewarm at best.

Diana's is Diana's - they have really good seafood. Now what they do with their seafood is sort of a hit or miss.

Overall, it's meant to be a greek restaurant style, but it's more so greek food for the Asian demographic. 

Overall, my general impression is that the chef doesn't quite get the delicacy of the seafood is working with yet cooks it to perfection. The scallops in pesto - over powering and the oil tastes stale. The octopus - grilled perfectly but the tabuleh and humus and pomegranate - too much and not well done. The tuna - served on seaweed salad....doesn't fit on the same plate as pickerel with sweet mash....very confusing and very strong flavours.

But what they do right are the classics. Great deal on Oysters - though i found the shucking to be a little poor - but when you're paying essentially $1.50 a shuck, you accept that.  The lavraki however - now this is the star of their menu. It's exceptional. No confusion - classic greek prepartion - the gril, some salt, some lemon and olive oil. The protein sings and the grill accents.

For our cocktail hour, I chose Metcalfe's to provide some appetizer trays as they were on my venue's preferred caterer list and I had experience of their quality product. It was definitely a bit more than I'd usually pay for trays of meats, cheeses, and the like, but I chalked this up to a wedding expense and didn't think much of it.

Come the day of the wedding, I was happy hitched and getting photos taken when I get a call ""Hi, this is SoAndSo from Metcalfe's and I have a delivery."" ""Yes,"" I say. ""I'm the bride and I'm not there. There are 2 planners on site as well as venue staff."" ""But I'm at the back door and no one is here. I have a delivery,"" says Metcalfe's dude. ""I'm not there! I've just gotten married. I'm having my pictures taken. Please just go knock on the front door. There are a bunch of people who can help you."" ""Yeah, I went to the front door, but it says {the venue} is closed for a private event."" *FACEPALM* Now I was annoyed. ""YES! And YOU ARE BRINGING THE APPETIZERS!"" I then just snapped a bit and told him to sort it out and that I wasn't to be bothered.

Later (perhaps 20-30 minutes later) we parked our car at the venue for more photo taking and the delivery van from Metcalfe's was just leaving. I got a dirty look.  When I later spoke to the person managing the venue for our reception, he had a laughable mention about the delivery guy as well. Clearly the dude was not a people person and very confused about how to deliver to an event (as opposed to a person's house, etc.).

The food was good, but didn't have labels as to what it was. I'd asked about this and was told it would have. So our very expensive platter of Wisconsin artisanal cheeses and dried fruits and such didn't get eaten as much as it might have. That thing was *not* inexpensive. I was a bit miffed.

This restaurant can be summed up in two words: mediocre & overpriced. I wish I had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews. The positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in, however, much to my disappointment. One spring roll is $4.50, although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid $3.50, which was still too much, in my opinion. They were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. The peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.

I had the Lemon Grass Chicken for dinner. The chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet. I couldn't detect even a hint of the lemon grass. The presentation was unappetizing, with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles.

I'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't want to be negative, but neither of them made any positive comments about their food.

The concept is terrific (farm to table), too. The service--I had a very professional and friendly mid-aged man--was also very knowledgeable and attentive. One of my party (a visiting professor) put up a mild huff about how the wine ""not being cold enough"" (something my cheap ass would probably let go from the get-go), but he handled it with aplomb. We got multiple dishes, including a cheese and bread tray, eggplant parm, some sort or cheesy kimchi thing, and another kind of braised beef. All were fresh and mouth-watering to the eyes. And the wine selection was fantastic. My only complaint--and it's enough to knock off a star--is that the food was just to darn salty. You had to drown out many of the dishes with the extra bread on the table. It's possible most of V Picasso's regular patrons like their food on the extra salty side, but I as well as my other dinner mates agree that you couldn't eat too much of the food because of the salt content. So that was a big disappointment, particularly given that everything else was spades. So if they can just cut back on the salt, maybe they're be on the track to 4 (hell even 5 stars) in my book. But until then... one can only hope and wait.",2.0,e4s5Zg0mBDDEDSPvLph8zg

Sam's club has hours just for buisness members starting at 7:00am.  You can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you.  All you do is go in a pay for it.

They have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium.  The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases.  They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card.

In addition to electronics, photo lab, optical center, bakery, meat department, they also have a little know ""clearance"" section at each Sam's.  You just have to know where it is.  Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a ""1"".  Most common is .71 or .81.  I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for .71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret.

They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.  They also will give cookies to children.

My boys also love the cafe where they get their ""pizza and drink please.""  Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it.  Prices are very reasonable though.

They also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing!

If you are not satified with your membership, you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund.  Their refund policy is really good as well.",1.0,Xx_CmzqtusAcZs-2ZCJuRQ

Pleasantly surprised that the restaurant had a dresscode, which is fairly uncommon nowadays. 

Only issue was finding parking due to the nearby SF Giants game, but eventually found a spot within a couple of blocks of our destination.

Walking into Bandera immediately reminded us of the old Houston's on Park Avenue South in NYC. 

Same subdued lighting and dark wood booths surrounding a vibrant bar scene. 

Soon learned that the Hillstone Restaurant Group which runs the Bandera chain also manages Houston's, thus the many similarities.

The food.  She had the Cajun Garlic Butter Salmon.  The rice was tender, the sauce was spicy - but not overbearing.  The fish was cooked masterfully.  Moist and flaky, not falling apart all over the place.

The crawfish.  I got a bag with corn and sausage; spicy Louisiana style.  The heat was PERFECT.  It was hot, but I never had to stop and sit because my mouth was on fire.  Many places struggle to find the delicate balance between flavor and heat, but that struggle was nowhere to be found here.  The sausage was tender, boiled in the same juices.

We came here for dinner last night and sat at the patio to watch the game. Honestly I feel like The Vig has one of the best nachos ever.

Everyone at the table had a bite of my dish because it was incredible. It wasn't overwhelmingly tasty like other mac and cheese dishes. The pasta was cooked perfectly and served in an iron  skillet. You can order their burgers or sandwiches and upgrade your side to a mac and cheese or pozole for just $3. So worth it! My boyfriend always orders the pozole. I am not a fan of pozole in general but The Vig makes it so well. 

For drinks, our server misunderstood my order and gave me a Four peaks peach ale instead of the AZ peach shandy.

I told her I want talking to her and that comment was more to myself.  She replied with you're not allowed to talk like that.  At this point I'm getting irritated because I honestly wasn't talking to her and I had explained that,  so I told her... generally speaking if I were going to ball someone a pain in the ass I would look them in the face and straight up tell them that they are a f#%#ing pain in the ass.

i ordered the fish ""banh mi"" and... it was so freakin' good. whilst i do wish it was in a more traditional banh mi style bread (baguette vs round bun), it had the perfect amount of heat and i totally dug the interpretation. and the kale salad? o.m.gooooooodness. i know the mac and cheese is good and all... but you HAVE to get the kale salad. it is green perfection. and so good for your eyes!

the husband had the burger which was.... uhm, possibly the best burger i've had in arizona??? yeah. it was like that. juicy and perfectly cooked. with a side of church potatoes - what what???? that was like the ultimate comfort food meal right there. ULTIMATE. it was delectable. 

bro got the porkwich... that much pig on a piece of bread honestly scares me... but it really truly worked. and i understood why people are fanatical about it. his side of mac and cheese? now THAT, my friends is a good m&c. it was cheeeeeeeeesy up the heezy, and no weird liquidy sauce, the pasta shape didn't put me off. i wanted to swim in that mac and cheese. ok, maybe not because that was a hottttt little dish, but... i really really really really loved it. and wanted to steal it and eat it all. now that i'm revisiting that experience, i dunno how i feel about that kale salad. i'm torn. i choose both.

my dad had the reuben, which to me is a man-which. it was decent, just not my flava. 
my mom had either the brown bag chicken or the grilled chicken. i don't remember because my bro's gf had the other one. they were both good and i am not a big chicken sandwich fan. perhaps not phenomenal, but i would venture to say i might at some point be persuaded to order a chicken sandwich from here. 

we had the deviled egg dip... the chips were good, but the dip was kinda forgettable. 
service was amazing, the ambiance and decor... impeccable.

The technician tried her best to draw the lines, but I was surprised the tools that she used, instead of a thin brush like I have seen used in other salons I've been to, she used a bulky thick brush. So all the lines came out thick, uneven, and wavy. I didn't really like it, but it was late and I didn't want to make a fuss. After a day, the lines really started to bother me, so I called to see if they would fix it being that I was charged $14 for design on 4 out of my 10 nails. On top of the manicure being $10 more than other salons, $14 for design, and leaving a 20% tip, they told me, they would charge me for fixing the nails. It's not about the money, obviously I spend money to get me nails done. It's about the lack of customer service that they offered. Think twice before going to this over priced salon that lacks good customer service and just wants your money. 


Thanks for actually responding on Yelp. However, it would've been nice to actually get this over the phone when I called, instead I was told there was nothing you could do, except charge me. The lines were thick and wavy, maybe you need to look closely at the picture to see that. As far as your 7-day policy, I called the very next day, so I'm not sure how that's comes into play. 
I ok'd the design cause we were already 2 1/2 hours in and like I said prior, I didn't want to make a fuss. 
My problem wasn't with the tech, she did a great job, besides the lines. My problem was with the management  not caring that I was displeased with my nails after 1 day and after dropping $70 in their salon. 
They treated me like I was trying to get something for free. If they had said, why don't you come in so we can take a look. Who knows I probably would've paid to get it fixed. But they didn't want to hear my side of the story. I love having my nails done, and always receive compliments on them daily.

There is only one other table with people at it in the whole restaurant. The waitress is extremely inattentive and seems to have zero care for her table.

I was very impressed with the variety, especially the seafood: 3 different types of crab, scallops, clams, mussels, and even lobster. Not sure if the seafood variety is like this every night or I just happened to visit on a special day. A selection of noodles, vegetables, and meats (beef, chicken, pork, and lamb) rounded out my choices. Each of the refrigerated items were portioned out on Styrofoam plates and wrapped in cellophane, which I thought was a little wasteful. In the center of the restaurant were a bunch of desserts and some cooked items such as fried rice, pad thai, etc. The theme of the non-refrigerated items was thai. As mentioned by others, there was also a condiment/sauce section.

Both broths were fine. The spicy broth was not that spicy and did not cause any numbness, but nor was it very oily. The meats were just okay, very lean, so they ended up a little tough after cooking. The lamb (a classic) and beef (eye of round?) were my favorites. I am not a huge crustacean fan, especially if I have to shell them myself, but I did enjoy the shellfish. The desserts were okay, nothing special. The meats could have used a little more marbling and an extra waitperson would have helpful.",2.0,gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg

Actually, my goal in life is to find the perfect AYCE place. This might be it...

First of all - the sashimi pieces are the size of a small child. I can honestly say I ate a whole salmon and a whole tuna to ma face. They also have talapia sashimi and talapia tempura - YUMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THE GALBI DOESN'T STOP FLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the staff is so nice - I ask for 40 pieces?? Sure! Anything I want - I AM THE KING OF THE SUSHI WORLD!!!!!!!!!

They have mussels - garlic butter and wasabi mussels, which is hard to find in a lot of AYCE places.

They have coconut shrimp - MASSIVE coconut shrimp. It's deep fried to golden perfection and not overly battered. 

Their maki have ONE layer of rice. Max 2. So little rice that I can see the seaweed through it. The pieces are exploding with fish. AMAZING!!!

Spider rolls and Kaze roll are my favorite. I think the Kaze roll is the one with 3 fish in it (salmon, white tuna and red tuna? maybe talapia) - ask them when you get there, some of the rolls have weird names but they are deliciousoooo.


I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE! ANYONE AND EVERYONE! PLEASE GO - don't listen to overly critical reviews. People have unreasonably high expectations for AYCE sushi. Kaze is quality and quantity and FREE POP. And it's relatively cheap - 20.99 for weekday dinner and 22.99 for weekend.",2.0,CvIEHZF79KLrpNachZzDjA

We started with the pig face and goat cheese dumplings.

The pig face was pretty average. Although pork belly and hoisin sauce is amazing the whole dish was overpowered by the sriracha but the goat cheese dumplings were great! The goat cheese was super creamy and melty while the sweetness of the beats were a perfect compliment. 

I have an obsession with ramen so I try to order it everywhere I go, so naturally I got the pork ramen. The broth was average but the pork belly was cooked decently. They also put kimchi in the dish and although I love kimchi, I think I would of preferred it without.

The California burrito had asada, cheese and French fries! ⁉⁉ I've never had a Mexican burrito with French fries.. And I'm also from CA so the name was odd to me.

I have been going to this location for over 20 years and the line never moved as slowly as it did today. There were very few people in line when I walked in but it was quite a while before anyone asked for my order. Both the people in front of me and behind me in line commented they had also never seen the line move so slowly, and they were also long-time customers.

I tried to figure it out since I counted five staff members on the line; one on the grill, one handling drinks and shakes (which left her just standing there most of the time), one putting the condiments on the orders, one at the register, and one handling the fries and onion rings. The only thing I could think of was the staff was new. One person looked vaguely familiar but other than that I didn't recognize anyone, and another person said ""I've never seen these people before."" The employees weren't horsing around; everything just moved very, very slowly.

Because I drove in from so far away I hung in there until I got my order, but if I lived closer I would have been long gone.  I don't like downgrading my initial positive review but I think management needs to be aware they have a customer service issue--at least they had one today around 6:00-7:00 p.m.

Ted's in Tempe has been a favorite of mine since the early 90's.  Though currently residing in Queen Creek, it's worth the trip now and then for a delicious, charbroiled jumbo all beef dog.  So many places come and go, but it's great that Ted's has been at the same location for years. Hope they remain for a long, long time.

So glad to see their business is booming during these less-than-great economic times. Long Live Ted's !!!

We booked online which was fairly easy. It was really a bummer that they only allowed us 15 minutes before our jump time to set up our room. The party room upstairs was set up nicely but we did have lots of decorations to put up so that took some time away from me being able to experience what Gravady had to offer. In between setting up and checking people in throughout the party I was only able to jump with the kids for less than 5 minutes before it was time to get back to the party room. The attendant we had was very helpful in serving our guests and cleaning up spills/messes. Everyone really enjoyed the experience and for many it was their first time going to Gravady. It is kind of pricey for just one hour especially when guests show up late and have only 30 minutes to jump. To offset the cost we made our own food so the fact that they let you bring in basically whatever you want really helped. The facility was very clean and bigger than I expected.. the only weird thing is that the jumpers either go barefoot or have to purchase gravady socks at $4 a pair. I'd much rather have the socks become a requirement and pay the price instead of thinking about all those dirty feet all over the place. The only suggestion I have for the staff is to think about how they can streamline the check in process or make is easier so that the host of the party doesnt have to run back and forth to check people in. And maybe space out party times by 30 mins instead of 15 so that we have enough time to set up and are able to enjoy the facility with our guests.

I have a regular stylist who went back home to Chicago for the summer. I was approached about this salon and their new location. I called, explained my hair type and style and asked who would be best to serve me. The receptionist advised me which stylist would be best, and I booked the appointment. I showed up 10 minutes early. The stylist I was told would be styling that day, rudely informed me she was a level 5 stylist with a full client list and any stylist in the salon could do a good job. I should have walked out then, but I didn't. I told myself, ""let's give the stylist a chance."" I came in with my hair done as I always wear it, I explained exactly what I needed and wanted as well as showed the stylist pictures. I left in tears, she BUTCHERED my hair!! I was VERY disappointed, I will never step foot in that salon ever again! I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone! :(

I have been to different hair salons trying to find a stylist that fits me. I was hoping to finally end this long search. This is why despite my initial interaction, I decided to give the younger stylist a chance. I honestly, was hoping to find someone I could rely on regularly. My current stylist is always in and out of town. She has done this for many years and this is no longer a job to her its hobby so she's not always available.

This was a complete disaster, I left in tears and cried for 3 hours. I had to go to Fantastic Sam's near my home to help clean up the mess the stylist left me with. I wear a sassy short hair cut but not a MULLLET! With the extensive explaining, and pictures I for sure thought I would leave at the least satisfied or with something I could work with! I cannot do anything but wait for this disaster to grow out. I am devistated, and I would think twice, three, even four times before you take a risk at this salon.

Specialty: German-style Sausage Hall
Menu items: Bison, Wild Boar and Venison Sausages with Duck Fat Fries

Who is in for a sausage party? Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.
Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read ""Verst"". And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.

Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.

Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Sautéed Jalapeños. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.

Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. 
But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.

Until next time Foodies!

I really wanted the barbecue pork, but I also really wanted the pork belly brussels sprouts, and I knew I couldn't possibly devour both at lunchtime. Our waitress insisted that I absolutely NEEDED to try both, and took it upon herself to ask the kitchen to make me the barbecue pork appetizer from the dinner menu instead of the entree from the lunch menu. I've never actually liked brussels sprouts that much (it was the promise of pork belly that lured me in, of course) but these were seriously good. I guess I've just never had them cooked right--super tender and drenched in butter. Least healthy vegetable ever, but also maybe the most delicious. The barbecue pork on a jalepeño pancake was awesome too, but the brusselsprouts were lifechanging.

Oh, and the beer selection here is interesting and varied, just like the menu. Our waitress enthusiastically brought us samples of anything we even pointed at on the menu before we could attempt to refuse them. I kind of wish it wasn't 2 in the afternoon so I could have had more than one...haha.

Various coupons/discounts are available for sauce which we used on both visits. Groupon $18 for $30 was used on the first visit and Yelp deal $50 voucher for $25, which was found on the Yelp app, was used on the second visit.

On our first lunchtime visit, we were sat in the bar area and I took the recommendations of our server Bernadette. For the appetizer, we had the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese. For entrees, my wife had the California panini and I had the Italian chimichanga. The common thread with our appetizer and my entree was the mix of pesto cream sauce and the tomato based marinara and arrabbiata sauces. I didn't think that was a good pairing. I might have the fried cheese again but without the pesto cream sauce. I wouldn't get the chimichanga again. There's too many ingredients (meatballs, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, mozzarella, and feta along with the arrabbiata and creamy pesto sauces) that just didn't meld well together.

On our second visit, we were seated on a Saturday night with one other table in the dining room. We ordered the kids fettuccine alfredo, the sauce sea bass (they were out of sea bass and salmon was substituted), and the create your pasta consisting of fettuccine, signature red sauce, meatball, roasted garlic, and mushrooms. If you're a garlic fan and not looking for any kind of make out session after dinner, order roasted garlic with your pasta. There were a total of about ten cloves of garlic in my pasta. For dessert, we had the zeppoli which was probably the best dish of the meal. Even with the lack of business, service was still slow. Everything was OK with this visit with nothing being bad, but nothing being that memorable.

The menu is large with a mix of traditional dishes and different creations so it's highly probable to find something of your liking. We just didn't score with either of our visits.

Since the one frustrating experience, the staff, notably Desiree and a couple of the male clerks (whose names I am forgetting but Austin is one, and the other guy has dark hair and a beard - sorry!) have been consistently professional, polite, good natured and efficient. I have been in the store dozens of times and have had nothing but good experiences since my original complaint/review. In the past 9 months, they've more than redeemed themselves, IMO, and I'm a harsh critic with high expectations. They have earned each of their 5 stars.

They have a tour once a month. It's pretty much walk in and stand in one spot because its a very small spot.

The beers aren't anything special and that might be because they constantly change their recipes. Their one-offs tend to be their best bets but consistency in making them again is apparently tough for the brewery. (Hence ""one-off"")

Just hearing about it from friends and reading reviews on Yelp made it that much more exciting. It's a very nice place, nice drive up entry and lobby, nice interior decor. It puts you in the mood for a nice relaxing dinner. Our server this night was Keith and he was very knowledgeable, prompt and patient. He explained everything from how the meal would be served, from the salad to the actual carving of the prime rib. You don't have to be concerned if you aren't sure what the various cuts of meat are. He said that when the chef comes table side he will show you the actual sizes. 

Okay. First off, you get your drink orders filled, then you start off with your salad when you are ready. The salad is prepared table side on a cart with a large bowl in a bed of ice. The server proceeds to spin the bowl and tosses the dressing into it. They have a house seasoned pepper to put on your salad which is made by Lawry's. Very good and refreshing.

Next comes the main course... The prime rib! Yours truly opted for the Diamond Jim Brady cut, medium rare which has the bone in. It' s actually not that big of a serving when you consider that the bone is in. I think it was a 16oz cut. It was done perfect and I had it with the creamed spinach. Mashed potatoes come with it and the au jus is laddled onto your prime rib. Oh, and don't forget the Yorkshire pudding!  Also, my dining companion and I decided on a sizzling plate of mushrooms which were sautéed in butter and garlic. 

As for dessert, well, that was far from my mind at the time! It was a very delicious and satisfying meal. If you decide on coming here for dinner, I suggest you have just a light lunch that day, I did and I'm glad I prepared myself for dinner! I really enjoyed my dining experience here and what made it even better was the excellent service provided by the employees here.

This place has been out for a while. The place is designed to look modern, but the place is overall dim, so you can't really notice anything negative or positive. Overall look is average.

Service here was impeccable. Even with a full house and people constantly coming in and out of the restaurant, I felt my table had 2-3 dedicated waiters at our beck and call. However, not everyone there speaks chinese though. Regardless, our plates were changed, soups were served into bowls, teas refilled, and fast paced service. The food just kept non-stop. Definitely top notch service for a chinese cuisine place, and a chain at that. 

My table ordered the 8 person combo, at $238 with green onion rolled pancake with sliced pork, 2 extra orders of Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Ground Pork, and Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Dried Scallops, Pork & Luffa. The combo included, 5 variety cold dish, fish maw soup, peking duck with lettuce wrap upgrade, broccoli and eggs, leg of a pig, seafood veggie mix, steamed fish, mushroom greens, and lobster e-fu noodles.

Let's start off with the extra sides. The steamed dumplings are definitely good. Not as good as Xiao Long Bao that opened up just down on huntingwood, but still better than most places. The green onion pancake with sliced pork is definitely top notch. I find most places skimp on the green onion, the sauce, or/either the amount of pork. This place got it just right!! I was honestly expecting subpar food since this place was a chain, but a lot of the items were above expectations. The ones that shone the most were definitely the 5 variety cold dish taking first, broccoli and eggs taking second, and peking duck takes the third.

The cold dish honestly surprised me, it is usually too cold, making it lack flavour or too hard/chewy to have good texture. This one was bursting with flavour, moist and appetizing. The eggs within the broccoli is usually tame, but this one made my eyes go O_O, ""what is this?"" I typically don't care for this dish, but this was unique. It was strong, but not too salty and it didn't require any vinegar at all. Peking duck taste third, since there was ample meat in each slice, and the mix with the lettuce was crispy and refreshing!

All pictures attached, and definitely recommend people come try, as this chain restaurant is better than some traditionally opened chinese restaurants!",0.0,x0cMhVpUcYYHoLdrWSNIMg

If that wasn't exciting we noticed cockroaches, beetles, and god knows what else crawling down through the walls and bathroom.

The one positive of this whole experience was the lady who helped us out at the front desk. Extremely nice and apologetic. I wish I remembered her name.

We were brought rolls and our drinks came quickly.  We ordered several starters to share.  First was a half chorizo that was cooked with red wine and flame grilled tableside.

Next, we had the dish Halloumi, goat cheese grilled over cypress and served with a sweet and sour sauce. 

Next came the snails cooked with a chardonnay white wine and garlic sauce and broiled with mixed cheeses and served with some toast slices.

Next was Bacalao, a dish made up of salted cod, mashed potatoes, garlic, onions, eggs and extra virgin olive oil and served with a salad of mixed greens.  Lubka (Luby) told us how they treated the salt cod daily with whole milk to remove the saltiness of the cod so it wasn't overpoweringly salty.

Then onto the chicken Trinchado.  The chicken is marinated in red wine and grilled.  It's then put in the Trinchado sauce which had a nice paprika flavor and a small hint of cumin.

Then we had the Calamari curry, a bowl of nicely cooked calamari in a curry sauce that didn't hit you up front but had a nice curry tang after the fact.  It was quite good.  With the calamari, we got rice and a container of chutney.  The flavors complimented each other nicely.

When we thought we had no more room, Luby insisted we have some dessert.  We went with the tiramisu.  It's quite a different looking dish from common tiramisu.  The  ladyfingers weren't like most tiramisu but there was a wonderful chocolate and 
coffee flavor in the ladyfingers and the mascarpone cheese made this a wonderful ending dish.

Service was outstanding for the two hours or so that we were there.  We asked that the dishes not be brought out all at once and they did one at a time.  Luby came to the table and asked if it was OK to start the next dish.  She explained the dishes when she brought them and she was an absolute joy!  She's very proud of her food and she has reason to be proud!  

This was a very memorable lunch with good company, good conversation, excellent food, and outstanding and very pleasant service.  Thanks to LJ and Niyen for the heads up on Vila Algarve.

If you go in the show expecting some type of Cirque-show you will be disappointed. However, if you go into it thinking you'll hear some good tunes and see some spot-on Beatles impersonators then you'll have a good time. :) My family and I were in Vegas during the week (M-Thu) and would you believe the top shows that we wanted to see were all blacked out (Jabbawockeez, O, and LOVE), but in order to make the best of the situation we decided to see the BeatleShow, mostly because my Mom is a huge Beatles fan. 

I would have to say that we really enjoyed ourselves. My parents enjoyed singing along and the emcees (in the form of Ed Sullivan, Austin Powers, etc.) tried to make it interactive as well. I do have to say that they really don't look too much like the Beatles (although the person who was George was really the closest match), however, they sounded just like them! And if I had to choose between looking like the Beatles or singing like the Beatles I would of course choose the latter. They sang and played their instruments wonderfully!

The show seemed a little short (85 mins I think is what other Yelpers are saying)  and I would've enjoyed hearing more songs (Obla-di-oh-bla-da, more psychedelic Beatles songs--Lucy in the Sky, Strawberry Fields) but for the price I was okay with it ($35). BTW, they are constantly doing deals on this show whether it be through Yelp, or Tix4Tonight, etc. so there is no reason why you should be paying full price!

The system originated with one man, Imi who developed it in the ghettos of Europe pre WWII and later fine tuned it in Israel. It is used by military, law enforcement and similar organizations worldwide. 

The ""Tribe"" is truly like family led by the ever vigilant and innovative Donavin Britt. Real life scenarios (ie disarming a knife/gun wielding attacker, plucking away a choke hold, getting OFF of the ground, getting to safety after thwarting an attack, etc) The instructors are all top notch and are truly interested in each student being the best he or she can be. 

Classes usually start with drills ranging from sprinting/suicides outdoors, to calisthenics to the point of exhaustion, Crossfit and even sledge hammers taken to giant tires out back. You work HARD here. 

Krav Maga isn't about mastering a fancy kick: it is about identifying a threat, neutralizing it and getting to safety. Though you are taught to break free from being pinned on ground, etc the focus is on being on your feet. This is not grappling.  

People of all ages from children to older adults benefit from this system. After training for a while, you can test for Fight Class which involves an all day series of everything you've learned up to that point amped up. Again, instructors and students alike support one another throughout the process as they do in class and beyond. 

Due to a bad concussion, I'm unable to participate in most of the Krav activities and I really miss it. Being empowered as a woman (or man) and having confidence that you can defend yourself and push past self imposed limits is an invaluable gift Donavin, DC and all of the instructors provide. Plus, it is a great stress reliever to kick & punch tombstone pads and all of the off the hook drills they dream up. 

I'd recommend this school to anyone who wants to learn the practical techniques and add new challenges to their fitness regime. Truly miss the Tribe and hope to be among them again, soon.",10.0,eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg

It's not that the wings were bad -- it's just that the hype of ""the best in the city"" means they have a lot to live up to.  Couple that with their own hype machine of  ""our medium is VERY HOT"", the running competition of who can eat the most, etc, and really, I expect something better than a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.

What I got is a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.  Juicy meat, sure, but way too much sauce* left the wings soggy.  I want some crispness to my wings.  Were they tasty?  Sure.  Are they worth over a buck a wing?  I'm not so sure.  Factor in their overpriced crap-domestic beer and mediocre fries and I'm left with little reason to go out of my way to visit the place.  Anyway, on to specifics:

I call a huuuuuge BS on their heat claims.  If I had known how run of the mill their ""Hot"" was, I would have instead ordered ""Superhot"" or ""Death"".  As a consumer, I find that misleading and disappointing.   

I've been a hot aficionado since I was ten years old.  I feel more pain biting into a jalapeno (3500-8000 Scoville) than I did eating ten of their ""hot""... a jalapeno is practically a fruit!  I didn't even have to blow my nose or clear my throat, nor did I touch my beer until after the meal.

Listen, I get it, marketing is king... but c'mon.  At least try to back it up!  

I'm a bit sad to do it, but Duff's clocks in at an underachieving 2 stars.  Not only have I experienced better, I've also experienced hotter.

The space is a great blend between industrial, rustic and upscale aesthetics. We had great service and our waitress was very helpful with recommendations.

We came over the holidays to celebrate a birthday and had a great adventurous meal. You can definitely come across items that can't be found anywhere else! We started the night with Salumi De Buca and we got the lardo, spalla and the salsiccine. It was my first time trying lardo in this way, and it's texture was like caramel but tasted like cream. Very interesting! Next was the Trota, steelhead trout with a yogurt and herbs on top. The raw trout was fatty and meatier-tasting than tuna sashimi (as a benchmark) but the preparation kept it light and balanced. The most adventurous dish of the night was the Cervello. It's basically lamb's brain wrapped in a crispy salty bacon wrap. It sounds crazy but the brain is very light and has the texture of cream-cheese. It was a fun dish.

Of course, if you want to be less adventurous there are plenty of pastas, pizzas and entrees to choose from. The table next to us had some younger kids and the kitchen was able to accommodate making simple pastas for them.",1.0,XbiKsujS_qxU3xsr0xUqmQ

I felt the flavouring needed more work.. But that's just my opinion. Some of my friends said it was good and others felt the same as me.

Been here a few more times (this is the only Asian style bar food on Main St). The food, in my opinion did get better. Can't wait till summer to come here with friends and just sit on the patio to drink beer and eat skewers while checking out Main Street!! Will definitely be back and recommend to others.

Overall experience is good, Korean waitresses are hot!!

Nice place to throw darts, watch sports on tv, and chill out on Main Street!!!

I placed an order with vitacost.com on 10/12/14 and I was very excited when they shipped it out that very night and received a ""delivered"" the very next day! I went to get my mail at the leasing office and they never got my package, in fact it is Memorial Day and no mail, no packages. I found that to be strange, so I said that my package says that it was signed for by a Robert E. and they claimed that no Roberts are employed.  So I called the neighboring leasing office and they said the same thing... weird. SO I called Ontrac and they claim that the driver delivered it and I should have it, just go to Robert E. I explained that we have no such person.  So her bright idea was ""oh just call vitacost.com maybe they will issue you a refund or replacement."" I said ""I tried them already, since you said it was delivered, I am S.O.L!"" and she then decided that she will ask the driver what happened and call me back. *Right like the driver is going to say ""Yeah I lost her package, my bad."" 

2 days later I get a call back, she says ""The driver says he placed it at the leasing office and it is there now.""  I put her on hold and with my 2nd line I called my leasing office and nope sure enough, not there.  SO I asked her to have the driver call me when he is there so I can prove it to you all that you're at the wrong property.  The lady told me that she can't do that. But she will contact him again and call back. 

The next day, I get another call from Ontrac, this time they say that the driver is adamant that he placed a door tag on my unit number and left the package in the leasing office.  So I said ""ok that sounds ok if the driver is lying out of his a$$!"" She said ""He swears."" I said ""I would like you to tell me... do I have an apartment number on my address?"" She looked and said ""Um, Oh, Um, No... there is no apartment number listed.""  I then said ""Then how the Hell did your driver leave me a Door tag???? He didn't, because your driver is a LIAR, since I know for a fact that my leasing office wouldn't have given him my apartment number!"" She said she would call him and then call me back. 

2 days later: I get another call, now from a completely different person, trying to sell me that last bit of garbage from the previous call, about the door tag nonsense.  She then decided that she would call me back. 

After 3 more days of no contact, I decided I would email them a letter of ""WTF happened to my package!"" I am still waiting for a response.

I have been coming here since they opened about six years ago. I am always serviced by Robert, who is the only good thing at this place and he will soon see he is simply too good for the people he works for.

One day, I decided to try the blow dry bar. I had a great experience with a nice girl. I then called to schedule another appointment with her and did not remember her name, so I referred to her as the white girl and then there were two other African American girls who work there.

The girl that I usually saw was not there this day, so I asked if they had any other people working who weren't the African American girls because I thought they only did hair cuts and African American girls hair. Either way, it is none of their business why or who I wanted to do my hair. I am the one PAYING!

I tried scheduling an appointment for my massage about a week later and the owner Scott gets on the phone and calls me racist and tells me that he does not want me to return to the spa. WOW! He then said he would call me back that day to talk further. He never returned my call. I had to physically go there and have the receptionist call him to give me a call. Talk about unprofessional. 

I never wanted to cause any problems here, but Eva, the owners wife, has not once acknowledged my existence when I'm spending thousands and thousands of dollars at her spa! And to think I wanted to be serviced by someone who doesn't even say hello to me or introduce themselves. Now I'm here to tell the truth about the sick minds behind this business.

They rail people in with their promotions and then when you go to pay, they only will accept one gift card per transaction. Do not waste your money at this place. They are frauds and make false accusations.

Also, the owner said he just fired an employee for making racial comments. What do you expect from a spa in the middle of FOX CHAPEL?! Every women who walks in that door has been fed with a silver spoon and more.",11.0,9Mkhe3Xl0Gn0mTmoXjUraA

Once upon a time, I thought Kinko's was this magical place full of neat machines and free paperclips that was constantly full of cool projects and was hopping twenty four hours a day. Then I began to need to use them for my job, and that's just when all the trouble began. First of all, very few Kinko's, if any, are even open twenty four hours a day anymore! But that was just the initial crack in their facade for me. See, I used to be able to just email them a document as an attachment, and put instructions in the body of the email. Then I would follow up with a call to make sure they got the file, which they always did. They would tell me over the phone when I could pick it up, and the orders were always on time. 

THEN everything changed. They no longer accept email orders. They have created the most complicated and horribly bass-ackwards program on their website to upload documents. I understand why they did it, and I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm just saying the program needs some major overhauling because it never ever ever EVER works right. Either I can't explain what I need to them through their structured questions, or it won't upload right, or the submit button doesn't work. Then, once I finally get it to work, I have to call them 20-30 minutes later. Generally, they still haven't received my file by my first call. So I call back. I'm left on hold forever, and when they return, they still have to ask a billion questions about my order because their system doesn't tell them what they need to know. It takes virtually forever.

I really feel for the employees at Kinko's. I once worked for a copy shop, and I know how hectic things can get. That being said, I have never witnessed more incompetent help in my life. I don't blame any of the individuals that work there, Kinko's probably just has provided very little useful training for them. But still, I dread going in there. Even to simply pick up a completed order, it will take no less than 30 minutes.

On top all of that, Kinko's is expensive. Needlessly so. Simply because they have a stranglehold over the copying business gives them no right to charge those ridiculous rates for various services. Blow it out your a$$, Kinko's!",2.0,1qXH9y2-j0tQImA1pU4WeA

There were so many rolls to choose from. Yeah, the sushi was not the freshest I've tasted in my life, but was pretty good quality and I like the small cuts so it's not too filling.

My two favorites are the Meatloaf Sandwich  and the Little Italy. The meatloaf sandwich is a meal in itself piled with meatloaf, bacon, bbq sauce and mashed potatoes - it makes me hungry just thinking about it! The Little Italy is Italian bread, prosciutto, fig spread, fresh buffalo mozzarella, and field greens. 

They have a several homemade soups on the menu (tomato bisque, shrimp and corn chowder, minnestrone) but also have two daily soups that range from anything from cream of mushroom to Guinness stew.

Don't forget the homemade cannoli! The flavors change daily too. So far I've had vanilla, pistachio, pumpkin, and peanut butter.",4.0,A0Tkq4VV8dD6t8NbBxvBPA

The thinly sliced meat, covered in a nice mixture of egg batter with a bit of sweets and then cooked to tenderness.  The meat jun did not disappoint, but I can't say the same for the rest of our meal.  I'm still on the fence about their dipping sauce too.

The soon tofu, came out bubbling hot, but it was not in abundance of tofu and the soup was more runny because of lack of ingredients in this dish.  The taste wasn't too bad, good amount of spice, just lack luster overall.  

The bulgogi in my opinion is always the sweetest dish.  it's never really the best cut of meat, sometimes fatty, but then once in a while, you get lucky.  I would say, mediocre for this dish.  

The seafood pancake was not cooked to crisp at all.  The batter was too heavy, making it a mushy pancake versus a more nicely cooked, no soggy batter in your mouth feeling.  The seafood was okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again.  

The worst of it all, was the banchan sides.  The kimchi, seaweed, cucumbers were all super dry.  You can see the marinade, but it was like it was sitting there all day and just lacked the water that vegetables are suppose to have.  

Service can be better, but the lady has all tables to herself.  I guess someone called in sick today?  It's a fairly cheap meal for Korean food.

I don't really know what i was expecting - I guess that the sausage would taste a lot different from a cheap BBQ'd Toronto street food hot dog - it really didn't. They might be home made and (possibly) one would assume nitrate free, but they didn't taste that much different. Even the hot dog buns are the same as the ones you get on the street (i.e. the exactly the same - yes, that cheap-ass bread that goes soggy the moment any moisture hits it). Surely a gourmet hot dog deserves at least a home made gourmet bun to go with it? We had two hot dogs. They both came with a rather nasty creamy coleslaw that doesn't really work too well in a hot dog. A portion of fries was greasy and soggy. Tastier sauerkraut can be found in the supermarket.

Service was fine and friendly - the place wasn't busy. However, they will need to move faster when there is a rush on.  The drinks on offer are actually more appealing than the food - very decent and surprisingly varied beer selection and home made sodas.

So onto value - with tax these hot dogs are pushing $10 a piece (some are over that). Are they 3x better than some of the hot dog vendors on the street? No. More importantly - would we recommend this place or be going back? - unfortunately not. 

Overall just really disappointing. I know it is the first day, but there are some fundamental misses here on the taste side of the house - the service was fine. We had high hopes for this concept, but I think we will stick with the gourmet burgers for now.",6.0,RKwt_HOfXCuNAEVscKkMgQ

It's a bit pricey. Two two-meat platters (comes with two sides), one pulled pork meal (one side), 3 drinks and tip was $56~

Ribs and brisket were decent, not the best, but better than most. I make ribs at home, so I'm super picky about these.

My wife and my dad both said the pulled pork was excellent. I thought their BBQ sauce was original and very tasty. I assume they're making it in house and that it's not a commercial restaurant product.

Mac and cheese was ok, with a good flavor but the texture was off. It was quite mushy. My wife loves green beans and she said they were really good. I had collard greens and these were cooked perfectly. I'm used to them being cooked with smoked meat for flavor. These were not, but were still tender and nicely seasoned.

Rooms to Go specializes in modern style furniture, unlike many of the other, more conservative, furniture stores in the immediate area. If you are looking for a more hip, modern look, Rooms to Go is where you want to start looking.

We were helped immediately by our salesman upon entering the store. He was able to locate the bed I was interested in and assisted me in finding the appropriate mattress for it as well. I ended up purchasing a matching chest of drawers and end table. 

We were assured that all the items were in stock and would be delivered on 2/29 to our home. The delivery people arrived on time today and had the entire bedroom assembled within 40 minutes. They were extremely professional and efficient.

We arrived around 12:30, and the place was not super packed but obviously busy. The decor was sparse but nice and fairly modern. We were greeted twice promptly, and told we'd be seated momentarily, which we were. Free chips and salsa were delivered -- my companion noted that the chips seemed like Doritos without any of the cheese or Cool Ranch flavoring on them, as they were perfect triangles and there was nothing special about them. The two ""salsas"" that came with the chips were flavorful but super watery, with no chunks of veggies or even any thickness to them -- when you dipped your chip, liquid just ran off and nothing stuck. Blah. Our server (not sure of his name -- on the receipt, it only said ""Server"") had the personality of a wall: not friendly, barely smiled, and had no recommendations whatsoever. We each ordered a margarita, and were asked if we wanted a small ($6.50) or large ($9.00). When we asked about the size difference, he couldn't explain it with either words (ounces) OR his hands (???) so we decided to just try the small size. VERY disappointing -- the glass was FULL of ice cubes, and I literally think I took about five medium-sized sips before it was gone. Also, it tasted mostly like water, with very little lime flavor and clearly less alcohol. For $6.50 it was a MAJOR ripoff. On to the food. Between the two of us, we ordered the tableside guacamole, one plate of three tacos, and one plate of a tostada and a taco. The tableside guacamole was made by a VERY sweet and friendly woman (maybe one of the owners?) who chatted with us through the making of it -- her bright personality was pretty much the only redeeming part of the whole meal. The guac was yummy, and we loved that it was customizable (you got to choose which of about six extra ingredients were mixed in), but it was made with only a single avocado and a few mix-ins and not worth the $8.49 price tag -- we were not even offered any extra chips beyond those already served with our ""salsas."" When the tacos and tostada were delivered, I was shocked: my friend's tostada was a normal size and looked tasty, but the tacos were TINY, maybe 4"" across (at least 2-3"" less than a ""normal"" corn tortilla). The filling was decent (I ordered one steak, one campechanos, and one pastor), but nothing to write home about. Our server checked in with us a few times during the meal, but made it seem like it was an inconvenience for him, plus never took any of our empties off the table or asked me if I wanted a second margarita (perhaps he couldn't see that it was empty due to ALL THE ICE STILL IN THE GLASS). He gave us our check before we were even done eating, and rushed us out at the end of our meal (even though the place was nearly empty by then) which was quite disappointing.

The decor and service were great especially for an after work rush.  Although, it is truly a verbatim Happy Hour that ends at 6pm.  Not the biggest fan of a short happy hour, but I understand that Downtown doesn't draw the same volume of people after work as Tempe or Scottsdale.

We decided to sit at the hightop bar so we could get a great view of the place.  It's a very open concept with a nice view into the hustling kitchen and outward view of the US Airways Center.  Great urban vibe.

The food is where it fell a little short. The Salmon sounded great with farro, fennel, and roasted apples, but didn't live up to it's $22 price tag.  Portion size was decent, but nothing outstanding about the flavor.  Maybe my time in NYC has spoiled my taste buds.

Our bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker.  She made a great drink.  I tried the Turkey Sloppy Joe feeling that the poblano peppers would pair well with the bourbon, but should have trusted my gut and figured that the sloppy joe was probably part of the kids menu.

Our server wasn't the best in the world she would barely come by and we were often looking for her and trying to wave her down but she was never available. The tacos were amazing.

It may be a bit closer but getting back out of the parking lot on to Camelback West bound takes forever.  That's not the reason for the loss of a star.

A burger choice that is normally very messy to eat with guac and meat juices and such running all over the place was sorta dry. And even picking the burger up in my hands it felt cool.  The side salad was OK.

What went from 6 people turned into 11 amazing group of friends going to dinner together. Midi is relatively small and cozy bistro but the staff handled our large group very well. The Winterlicious menu was only $25.00 and I would say you definitely get your dollars worth. 

As a starter I had the Salad Midi which was nice and light way start to my meal. It was made with mixed greens, prosciutto, asiago cheese, dried berries & pesto drizzle.  But of course, I had to steal from others plates as well. The Crostini was superb as well! For the main, I decided to go with the Fettuccini with Black Tiger Shrimp, Atlantic Salmon, Mussels, Roasted Red Peppers, Baby Spinach in a Rose Sauce. I was slightly disappointed with the main. I wish they had made the salmon and red peppers into bigger pieces instead of blending it into the sauce. The Black Tiger Shrimp was amazing and fresh though. For dessert I had the Profiteroles which is Choux Pastry with Vanilla ice Cream & Hot Chocolate Sauce. It was my first time trying Profiteroles and I have to say I didn't enjoy them as much as I would have liked to. The Choux Pastry tasted somewhat like soggy pancakes because the ice cream was melting and the Hot Chocolate Sauce tasted like store bought chocolate sauce. There was nothing special about it.

Damn Holler & Dash, I tell you what, there's some magic going on behind that counter. I guess I should elaborate!

Around here is where I'd typically insert the obvious hollaback one liner. I'll yield to the other reviews, you beat me to it! When you walk in, the warm, natural interior design makes you feel very welcome. Good use of several elements such as stone, timber, and an exposed ceiling give the whole dining area a spacious atmosphere. When I visited Saturday morning it was very clean and ready for a big rush.

Speaking of rush, if you want a calm visit then make sure you stop by as early as possible (they open at 7am every morning). The place fills up very fast. Fortunately they have a TON of staff on hand to handle to the heavy hours.

My first visit I tried one of the signature biscuits: Chicken Set Go! There was a bit of a sticker shock on the price at $9, however once you get it, you'll see that this is no ordinary biscuit. First of all, it's HUGE. I mean the top half of the biscuit is larger than the whole of what you'd get at most places. This particular creation had moist, seasoned fried chicken topped with pimento cheese, pickled jalapeno, sorghum, and served with a side.

It's a winner! Wow, that chicken tho. The chicken was moist, and had the right concoction of spices. Perfectly breaded and fried right on the money. Just the right amount of crunch for a best-case biscuit. Pimento cheese provided a delicious creaminess and the pickled jalapenos the right amount of sour astringency to redline all of my tastebuds. Who knew a biscuit could be this complex, yet all come together to make the breakfast of your dreams? What I thought was overpriced at first all the sudden had a ton of value in size, taste, and presentation.

The cheese grits were very good. A lot of ""Southern Breakfast"" places around here give you a bowl of grits that look almost watered down, for me the thicker the better and here they do it right. Very well seasoned too, which is not always a gimme when it comes to grits. The kitchen staff has really proven themselves with my breakfast.

I would not say it's our favourite restaurant for lunch, but it's definitely our default when we want an Asian fusion joint with a quiet atmosphere. There is a lot of natural light that streams into the small space during their operational hours, so that most likely contributes to this too, mood-wise. 

Its concept is nice: western cafe meals (eg. Pastas, casseroles, fries, etc.) with a Japanese twist. 

Even though I have a penchant for Japanese fusion cuisine, this cafe falls flat. When I first went here the servers were attentive and the food had a more memorable flavour. Now, the servers never swing by at all. Some may like this, but when one expects bottomless coffee to be refilled, this doesn't sit well. After receiving your food, don't expect servers to even look at you again (the two servers were too busy talking to each other near the cash register). I heard that there is a revolving door of workers here, so this may be why the staff seem less professional than I remember.  As such, be warned about the bill: I asked for split bills, but one waitress said that wouldn't be possible unless we paid in cash, whereas on my second attempt another waitress had split the bills for us without question.

I very seldom buy anything, but I love to look, try new clubs, and see all the products that will supposedly make me a scratch golfer.  So once every couple of weeks, I visit all the golf stores in the area.

I had heard of Golfsmith through national advertising, but had never been to the local store.  So I added Golfsmith to my rotation.  They are located in a shopping center in North Scottsdale, in a nondescript location next to Staples.  They are hard to find, and not really convenient, but they do have a well stocked store.
         
Although they do not have the volume of the PGA Superstore, they have the same selections (just in smaller quantity) and can order any custom club you want.  They also have a swing area, several pros on staff, and club repair.  Their apparel selection is average, but tasteful.

One of the advantages of Golfsmith is that they stock Titleist products, which the PGA Superstore does not (they are in a contract dispute with Acushnet). 

The staff at Golfsmith, for the most part, are very friendly, and helpful.  They will answer your questions, but are not pushy or over selling, and will simply let you browse without bothering you.

Let me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. 

As far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.

My dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. 

We ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. 

Something tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.",6.0,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A

Wandering through this park after dark is eerie enough, but wading through it at 3am in the fog?  With all kinds of people dazedly roaming around staring at creepy art installations?  Priceless.

This park offers some rare downtown hill climbing, which is great if you want to add a little switch to your workout routine (or if you just like rolling down hills).  In the midst of fall foliage season or the first blooms of spring, heading down to Trinity Bellwoods for a little nature loving is practically a requisite pilgrimage.  And while it's a little less impressive than the more Westerly High Park, you are certainly going to feel a little sigh of green relief after an afternoon's frolick (preferably after brunch to work off the Hollandaise-related fog).  

This city can be so gray at times, especially if your neighborhood has more concrete than grass.  Stepping into the park for a few hours' stroll is a huge way to decompress.

Yes, the biz operates in a very counter intuitive manner, I mean come on, cash only (they do now have an ATM at the front, after 70+ years in biz...), no restroom, the employees are anything but friendly, even when they call your number, they say ""24"", not even ""number 24"" or ""now serving..."" just the number, and in such a disgusted tone. And nothing but outside seating in the scorching heat (although they do have misters)? 

But really, would any other tactics do this place justice? The place is nasty, in a nasty part of town, what, should they have spent some money unnecessarily, given the place a little spit shine, made it pretty, trained the staff to be more chick fil A like? No across the board, their biz is perfectly in line with the totality of their circumstances.  

Now, where I do disagree with the 1 star reviews is the food. It may be nothing more than ""glorified fish sticks"" accompanied by ""watered down ketchup"", but dammit that watered down ketchup has el pato sauce in it and the fish sticks are much larger than the kind you buy at the store, plus they are deep fried. So five stars for the food! 

My wife gets so angry because this is my chosen place for birthday lunch each year. I must admit, there is a component of nostalgia to my five stars and that would be due to the re-enactment of cherished moments of my youth (as I shed a lone tear...) because Pete's was one of the few strong holds that continued to offer Dr. Slice after many others stopped.

Granted, this Safeway does have its share of transients (who overnight at the park across the street), but all in all it's a pretty good grocery store.  For the most part it's clean. They provide those sani-wipes at the front door, and the wine and floral selection is kickin.  On occasion, I've seen some check-out mayhem, but for the most part they do a good job (during daylight hours anyway) of adding checkers when needed and are usually very helpful and pleasant (considering they're being paid minimum wage to do a job that you do yourself at Fresh & Easy or any supermarket on the east coast).

I will say I was bummed today when I did 95% of my shopping only to get to the end and find that they had neither the brats, nor Italian sausage I was looking for and i had to make a double grocery excursion to hit up the ghetto Fry's on Thomas.

I'm truly disappointed. Their dim sum wasn't fresh anymore. How would I know? 1. I inherited my parents' (my father used to be a chef) canine-like nose and taste, so I definitely know when something isn't fresh. 2. I've been to NYC and Atlanta, so if you want fresh dim sum then you have to try those places first and then tell me if Dim Sum is still good or not. 

I'm not trying to be mean, but this place isn't authentic anymore. I think due to the change in clientele that this place americanized their dim sum.

My most recent visit resulted in a sandwich with what I'd consider to be ingredients-gone-bad. I brought the sandwich down and returned it and felt like the manager in charge at the time was defensive and unhelpful. Since I can no longer trust the food, I have since not been back (nearly two months now). 

When Byte is good, it's great. But recently there has been more bad days than good, and I hear constant complaints  from co-workers about how good it used to be and how shoddy everything has become.
 
I suspect Byte has been a victim of its own success, and doesn't really have the infrastructure to handle both delivery and in-person pick up.

A few friends and I came after hitting some bars at midnight to grab a bite to eat and have some beers. The waitress (a stubby Caucasian lady) came over and we asked about their beers - she promptly turned a drink menu to us. Then we asked about the shooters they had and she rudely said ""uh like all of them"". Okay. I think part of your job should be to know at least a few of those shooters and beers to recommend to customers. It was apparent she didn't want to be there. 

Later on, the bill came to $46 so my friends put down two twentys and a ten. The waitress came over and said ""you need change?"" and we did not. I did not want my friends to pay for me but I only had a $50 bill with me. She saw that I wanted to pay for my own meal so she came over to me and quickly said ""Your meal was $10, if I give you two twentys (from the pile) and take your fifty, then you have paid for your meal"". Me, being a bit buzzed and tired said ""Sure"" and then she quickly took my fifty AND the ten dollar bill. Right away my friend realized ""You know we tipped her $14 for shitty service right?"" I was appalled - it felt like she manipulated me in order to get $10 more tip. I would be ok with tipping 30% IF the server was friendly and actually made it seem like she wanted to be there but she didn't. The waitress didn't come back with the change. I hate being played so I asked the other waitress there if we could have the change back and I would leave the tip on the table. We then watched as the other waitress talked to our waitress in the corner clearly throwing shade and talking shit about us. And boy, did she take her time getting the change. My friends were ""too prideful"" to stay and wait for the change but I'm quite sure she had no intention of bringing it to us. 

I use to work as a waitress and I NEVER would assume that I could keep the change nor would I ever manipulate customers to tip me more. The next day I called and explained the situation to a worker there and she took my name and number and said she would call back later - she never did. Obviously, a $10 loss isn't a big deal at all (even though I am a poor student). However, I don't like how she manipulated the situation and took advantage of customers.

If there is a problem with the tires that isn't typical, their customer service skills and professionalism weren't apparent to me... 

I purchased a set of wheels and tires for my truck in July of 2011, have had a constant vibration at highway speeds since these were installed (until this past Wednesday, new tires from Firestone, they match prices too, go figure). Returning week after week (I work during the week, would go here on Saturdays) didn't solve it, they'd re-balance, tell me they were going to torque the rims with the vehicle up in the air, tell me they would do a road force balancing, etc. then blame the truck!

I have lifetime alignments on the truck, every 5k there is an oil change, alignment adjustment and rotate and balancing. Front end has been checked by Nissan, Firestone and yours truly.  I don't think things have changed that much in the industry from 15 years ago where I would call the manufacturer of the tire and work out a pro-ration and exchange for a different type of tire (customer pays for tread used) when a tire just doesn't work on a vehicle or someone isn't satisfied with the tires. I was at the point where I was ready to purchase 2 new to replace the worn and talk to Yokohama about pro-rating the other 2. Almost 3 years of ""trying"", we're done. 

Straw the broke the camel's back though was their selective measurement of the tire tread. 4 months ago, I was measured at 5/32nds (new is 10-12 and legally bald is 2-3). 2 months later I bring her to Discount to see how much I'll get for the mileage warranty and was told the tires are at 6/32nds.... no way they can do a mileage warranty. They wouldn't measure the center that was showing wear bars. I leave... 2 weeks later, have the truck at Firestone for her alignment and oil change, they measure the rear tires at 4/32nds and find a nail in a sidewall of one of them. OK, 4/32nds at FS, 6/32nds at DT, let's go use my replacement certificate. Of course, when measuring for a road hazard replacement, they only measure the center which is at 2/32nds.  NOW he wants to talk mileage warranty?!??!?!  Now I know why that lady threw her tire of the store in their commercials =). Ever not satisfied, just bring it back...?

Aside from that, we were greeted with a friendly smile and brought to our table.  We brought our teenage kids this time to celebrate as a family.  I was struck by the addition of appetizers and the plethora of non-prime rib options rattled off by our server.  We came to Lawry's for the prime rib - there are plenty of places in Vegas for other items.

We all opted for the prime rib and enjoyed the experience of having the carving cart brought to the table and our orders sliced fresh on our plates.  Asparagus and potato strings were ordered additionally, however, it took quite a long time for these side items to arrive at our table (we were almost half way through our meal).

They used to have a delicious trifle for this purpose, but it is no longer on the menu.  That is a shame, because it was super tasty.

 First of all, it's unclean. The cooking equipment needs a good scrub and the counter by the front window is so greasy the arm of my shirt stuck to it! Oh, and there were flies all over the place.
 Secondly, the cost is excessive. They want $12 for a four ounce piece of haddock [with chips]. That's about three dainty bites. They try to make the fish look bigger by pounding it thin, but that just means it absorbs more fat from the fryer.
 Thirdly, it's just not very good. As mentioned above, the fish is greasy and it's also overwhelmed by the batter. The chips are soggy, and as they cool down they seem to coagulate into a big, mushy ball of carbs.
 There was a highlight: the pop was really, really cold...good fridge, I guess.

Pros: 
-Beautiful rooms with kitchenette, fridge, jacuzzi tub, 24 hour room service
-Free shuttles to Wynn and Caesars palace that we never waited more than 5 minutes for
-Fashion show mall across the street is awesome
-Cheap for a five star hotel
- ""Free"" wifi included in the resort fee
- Quiet and smoke free
-free 4pm checkout time if you call the desk! Loved this.

Cons:
-No casino for those who do care
-pool is dead, go to Wynn for a real pool!
-Cost us 6 bucks to use the business center Internet...
-Limited restaurant choices ... I.e. there is like, one really expensive one
-Since it is off the strip views are kind of weird in most rooms.

The Trump is a great hotel for those looking for a luxury experience without a big price tag. We spent most of our time at the Wynn /encore anyway so the shuttle was perfect.

We were told that there would be a 15 minute wait and we were welcome to get a drink at the bar while we waited for a table. A couple of hands of the almost broken and booze covered video poker at the bar and 20 minutes later I enquired about our table and we were told that they had called our name and we hadn't answered. They knew we were at the bar (only a few paces away) so they couldn't have tried too hard to find us. A minute later the group sitting next to us at the bar had the exact same thing happen.

After our table was cleared up a couple of minutes later we quickly ordered a couple of margaritas, which came out with snake lollies in them and were quite nice! A few more of these and we'd forget about the issues getting a table. Unfortunately service was very swamped and getting one more drink, let alone a few more, was almost impossible.

The drink selection is good on the wine front and okay on the cocktail front (avoid the mango martini - the purée is WAY too filling), and the food menu is a compact but diverse two pages.

I think the best use of Bombay Palace would definitely be to go in a big group of sharers. At $10-12 a pop, dishes are too pricy (and big) to get a whole bunch between two people, but perfect for sharing if you want to get a taste of many things.

I have a puppy that has a lot of energy and this park is pretty big, giving her lots of room to run around and, of course, get tired. I don't like to go too late in the day because there are just too many dogs and she gets distracted, but my late morning trips have always been a pleasure. 

My one dislike about the park is that part of it appears to be a retention basin. Water collects and stagnates in a particular area and they use PVC and plastic fencing to block it off. It doesn't do anything to keep the dogs out. They need to re-engineer where the water runs off or determine a better way to secure that disgusting pool of water.

The park does not have a section for timid or small dogs and one for large dogs. I've seen people bring toy sized dogs, 2-3lbs, and I was a little concerned the dogs would get trampled/ attacked. I caught my little 20lb Basenji mix stalking one of these tiny dogs, so I had to shift her attention. If you want to bring a tiny dog to this park simply for socialization, I'd recommend being the dog during a time there would only be a hand full of dog owners around, so you can better monitor your dog.

It was out and delivered together, which I found strange.  The spring roll was nasty.  Possibly slightly over fried and a dark brown.  I ate just one of the two.  The pan-fried noodle was decent, not anything I'd write home about.  Not much meat, plenty of vegetables and not much flavor to inspire me to eat more.

All other comparable hotels were easily over $500 for two nights so I ended up going with South Point for roughly $300 for two nights.  

At first I was a little worried about staying here mainly due to the commute (not the quality of the place as it was opened in 2005) but I was happily surprised.  

Check in was a breeze even though it was the Friday before NYE and everyone was coming into town.  Even though there was quite a long line the casino had all the counters manned and checking in and getting into the room took less than 20 minutes.  Moreover, during check in they also give you a coupon book for some free stuff or buy one get one free stuff which was kind of cool.  Only complaint was that when calling in to inquire about when you can check in took about 10 minutes on hold to get to speak with someone.

The room itself was very spacious and clean and comes with all the amenities that you would expect from a reputable Vegas hotel.  Our room consisted of a king size bed, flatscreen TV, table, and a sofa (along with the rest of the nightstand, drawers, and closet).  This room could easily stuff 6 or so people in it if you really wanted to.  Moreover, it was nice how their bathroom was divided into two, with a door between the shower/toilet and the sink, thus allowing two people to share the bathroom at a time.  Definitely no complaints about the spaciousness or cleaniness of the room here.

Moreover, while I did not get to try out their amenities during my stay this time, I think I will definitely be back next time to try out their midnight madness bowling.  Apparently, during the weekdays after midnight all games are only a dollar!  I mean can you imagine, forget beer pong, how about beer bowling or a shot for every pin left standing haha.  

As for the food of this place, again I did not get to try out much but their Steak N Shake seemed like a decent and moderately priced place to get a meal.  I actually ended up getting a togo order of 3 sliders and shake for about $11 bucks so that wasn't too bad.

As for the convenience of this location, well for off-strip, it is pretty convenient even during NYE.  Located right off the freeway, it is easy to get to and out of into the Strip.  It is about a 15 minute drive by freeway and about a 20 minute drive by Las Vegas Blvd (I like how you have two routes to this place) with either being traffic free by the times I was driving.  

As a note, if you are planning to come here for New Years park at the Mandalay Bay!  The Strip is closed until 3am but as Mandalay Bay is at the end of the Strip you can still get out and take either Las Vegas Blvd or the freeway back without much hassle.

Only complaint with this place is that their shuttle to and from the Strip (cheap at only $8 all you can ride for a day) only runs till 1:00am.  Who goes back to the hotel at 1:00am in Vegas...especially on New Years.  They should make it 24 hours or at least 24 hours on the holidays.",2.0,Y3A5aF0d-rbWK8bk48h3Lw

a friend and i were actually looking for a different mexican restaurant, one she tried to go to on a sunday and monday, the only two days they are closed, and when we arrived on saturday evening, we found a sign saying they have moved from phoenix to mesa.  clearly not destined to patronize that restaurant.  

anyway, we'd passed the sign for this tiny strip mall restaurant and decided to head back and give an unknown place a try. the atmosphere is pretty generic, there are both booths and tables and some typical mexican decoration. doesn't transport me to a mexican pueblo, but it's not a tourist trap either so i was pretty comfortable.  after a quick scan of the menu my friend decided on the green chili burrito smothered with cheese and plated with beans and rice. ($6.75) i went for the chiles rellenos with rice and beans. ($9.25)

we ate some average tortilla chips with some super spicy red chili salsa and though our meals were out in record time we got a free refill of the chips when we drained the first bowl. 

my chiles rellenos were excellent.  dark green chiles lightly breaded, filled to the brim with white cheese and smothered in a spicy green sauce with some extra cheese on top. rice tasted like it had been cooked in beef broth and the beans were definitely cooked with a ham bone.  i'm a vegetarian so i had to skip those but there were two big chiles and i got hot fluffy corn tortillas so i didn't need the sides anyway. (but $9.25 is a little steep for what i was able to eat) 

Kate started to dig into her plated burrito when she realized that it was not a 'green chile burrito' but a pork burrito with green chile sauce.  she's not a vegetarian, and is literally the calmest and nicest person i've ever met, but she was pissed. she didn't send it back under the pretenses of false advertising, which she probably should have, but she was really annoyed and even as we were leaving she commented that she would never go back to a place that doesn't label their menu items correctly. 

so on the one hand i would go back there in a heartbeat, quick service, good food and for the most part decent prices, kate would list it on a top ten places to avoid list. i would say if you're on baseline and you want something that doesn't pander to gringo's head over to el mesquite and give it a try.",4.0,rzq5nqG2NG13o3ISxJSrsQ

My battery was dying so I made an appointment at 5 to have it checked out.  After a little over an hour Keith called me and stated that, yes my battery failed and that it was replaced under warranty.  I am like cool but then he showed me the multi point inspection sheet that my front brakes were at 3 and 2 mm and my rear brakes were at 7mm.  He said it would cost 329.00 to replace the front brakes but I had my kids so I told him I couldn't at that time but will comeback in a few days.  So I left and went home and told the wife the outcome.  She then stated "" weren't the brakes at 8 or 7 the last time it was there?  I was like yea your right, so I went and took out the invoice and looked on the inspection sheet and yes it stated my front brakes were at 7mm(Green) and rear at 5mm(Yellow).  That was on 18 Jan 16 and my mileage was at 28,500. So within a month and half, 1,200 miles later my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and rear brakes went from 5mm back to 7mm.

So from May 2014 to Jan 2016 and 5 to 28,500 miles my front brakes went from 10mm to 7mm and rear brakes went from 10mm to 5mm which sounds about right.

Now from 18 Jan 16 to 2 Mar 16 and 28,500 to 29,700 miles my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and my rear brakes went from 5mm to 7mm, so again doing the math my front brakes lost 5mm and rear brakes gained 2mm.  So just under 2 years I lost 3mm, then under 1.5 months I lost 5mm...I don't think so.  They obviously tried to scam me into getting front brakes when I don't really need them and I would have got them if it wasn't for my kids being with me at the time.

   ---   ---   ---

I've been flying into Hopkins since I was 2 years old. I waited all year long for our annual summer vacation to spend in Cleveland with family.

The problem with Hopkins is that it seems like it hasn't been updated a ton since 1986. Everything just kind of seems old and worn. 

And as an avid defender of Cleveland, I feel that the airport doesn't do the city any favors. Cleveland has always been the butt of any joke related to a city that just generally sucks and is totally undesirable. But Cle gets a raw deal here, as there's plenty of awesomeness in the 216 and the 440. 

So my please to the folks in charge of such things: update stuff! Make the airport not look like the mid 80's everywhere. Signage, decor, the flooring, etc. Let's join the modern era! I'd love to see the reactions of people dreading a business trip to Cleveland, who exit the plane, and say, ""wow... this is..... NICE!""

I'd have to disagree.... but it's not bad like some of the other places in Vegas.

Pros: 
-Menu options are great, especially on the back where you can get large combo platters if you and a friend want to share a variety. 
-Menu is pretty clear and easy to understand. 
-Lobster claw game at $2 a play is entertaining at best but difficult to grab, lobsters are usually clumped together in the corner
-Sauce is not oily like the competition which kept my stomach ache free

Cons:
-There was a manager lady who wasn't friendly at all. I was seated by a gentlemen but the lady came by to drop off the menus without a single kind gesture, and didn't even ask if I wanted anything to drink while I wait for my friends.
-The sauce is less oil but lacks heavily in flavor. The hot n juicy special is loaded with spices and garlic to give you a delicious kick. The sauce here was spicy but bland
-All the seafood is market price and listed on a tiny neon menu in the center of the restaurant. Maybe putting more around the restaurant so people don't have to get up to see it
-Shrimp is puny.....  (no pun intended)

Overall: I'd come back with friends but this wouldn't be my go to. I think i'll just stick with my pepto and hot n juicy",1.0,lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg

Prepared to just forgo my appointment with Pearson and make a new appointment with Visionworks, I inform them the reason for my visit (Glaucoma check) and ask them if they have my old records to compare my next visit with.   Thier answer:  ""We have you on file but your records are in storage"".   I'm not sure what that means.  Are they still using manilla folders and file cabinets?

My family is predisposed to Glaucoma and Diabetes and I fear blindness more than death itself.   Dr. Hagstrom picked up on this, and explained every test (and the results)  AND...Even though I had my retinal scan done (which was probably more than adequate) she also dialated my pupils and inspected each eye herself.    Long story ... L O N G E R ...  I get home thinking my eye pressure was in the 90 range as that was the readings I got off one of the tests.  Through google I learned that 20 was a normal pressure.  A tad bit panicked I called late Friday and left a message asking for clarification.   Dr. Hagstrom called me herself the following morning (a Saturday) and put me at ease and explained that the readings of ""90"" that I remebered were another unit of measurement for a different kind of test.

They appear to very much be attempting to be a place that views food as art, although I am not entirely confident that NoDa is the best place to be so esoteric. The ""faux"" bq tacos missed the mark; I believe they were attempting something along the lines of a miniature puffy taco you can get in San Antonio and elsewhere around Texas, but it came off as dry and bland.

That being said the smoked wings were GREAT! Just the right amount of spice and with four big full wings (still joined flat and drum, so really eight wings) for $9, I was a happy camper.

So we thought that was the start time of the show.  I'm not sure if it's Tickmasters fault or Ak-Chin Pavilion, but boy were we mislead. The show didn't start until 7:00pm.  So for two hours we had to kill time with medicore-at-best food with ridiculously expensive drinks( $4.50 for water and $13 for 20oz beer). Thankfully they didn't charge for parking, but I would rather pay for parking and eat at a restaurant with better food than be forced to buy food/drink at the Ak-Chin Pavilion.

The sound was decent.  My friend and I sat fairly close in hard plastic chairs. With the show starting at 7 and not ending until 11, the chairs were definitely not comfortable by the end of the night.  Also, like another reviewer stated the huge overhead fans were nice at the beginning of the show, but as the evening progressed and the wind picked up I became very cold in my seat.

I tend to practice and teach at night, though I do come on the weekends as well. So first and foremost the clientele is all different ages, I love this and we strive hard to create a true community. We offer 4 different types of classes majority of which are 60 minutes, 3 out of the 4 are heated and 3 out of the 4 are sequenced. I first came to my yoga mat in Denver at CorePower, upon moving back to Arizona I could not find a comparable format or studio. So I made due and traveled a lot around the valley.  We have been open since September of 2015 and while we do have clientele from ASU, we also have a Tempe studio opening up this Month (March 2016) right across from ASU. Guess what you get your first week free, no other studio does that. Trust me I know (remember above the traveling I talked about).  With that being said come give it a try and hey guess what when you join one CorePower you can use them all.

i've been here on two occasions and ordered food on both, as well as an iced americano and regular iced tea.  the first time we grabbed a table inside and my friend and i split the vito's favorite in a wrap. it was $8 of pure italian deliciousness. packed with lettuce, tomatoes, salami, ham, and much more. it was huge, a half was more than enough. the side of cole slaw had pepper in it which gave it kind of a kick that i've never experienced in a cole slaw before. the second time i went i had the greek wrap which wasn't as good as vito's favorite but still packed a kick ass greek punch.  

the coffee is good, i was chatting with the [assumed] owner and he mentioned he gets the beans roasted especially for him from the cave creek coffee company. it was brought out to my table with cream and sugar and was perfectly bitter with a hint of sweet earthiness.  the iced tea was average, it's not brewed cup by cup but they charge you like they do. 

they close at 9 during the week which sucks, because i procrastinate til it gets dark and then trip out into study mode, and have a hard time finding a good place to grab a bite, cup of coffee, and focus. i find it to be a laid back place to get work done and bust out that 10-15 page research paper you put off until the day before it was due.

The first experience was perfect. Our waiter was attentive, our orders had come at a timely manner and the food tasted really good. My boyfriend had the ayce sushi and was mentioning how this place would be our go to sushi. He mentioned how fresh the fish tasted and how quick we got our sushi. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo bento which came with soup, salad, vegetable tempura, shumai, salmon teriyaki, rice, and California roll. The salmon teriyaki was delicious. I wanted more! Our bill was around $50-$60, but it was worth it and decided we would come again. 

Today, Our experience was less than great. We had come around dinner time, but there was only two other booths taken. We sat down and was asked what we wanted to drink. I don't remember our waitress' name, but we wished we had the male waiter instead. We had asked for waters with lemon. She came out with just water, and then gave us the menus and a paper ayce menu. She was about to just take the paper menu and leave, but I had to mention that I wanted to order off the regular menu. I told her my order and I had to repeat myself and point to the menu since she didn't understand ""snow crab"". I then asked for lemon for our water and then she left. Few minutes go by and she tends to the other tables, 5 more minutes go by and wave her down and ask for slices of lemon. She looks as if she understands by smiling and nodding and then leaves. 5 minutes go by and I get agitated since I have asked 3 times for lemon. My boyfriend and I see the male waiter and when we asked for lemon, he came back very quickly. I noticed he was tending to other tables that started coming as well. 

A few minutes go by and my salmon teriyaki comes with the rice. It was flavorless. I didn't order the combo this time and was just expecting salmon, rice, and a salad. No salad came and the teriyaki sauce was sunken to the bottom of the salmon. My boyfriend made a comment saying I was suppose to get a salad. The waitress seemed surprised and asked if I wanted a salad. When I said yes, she left quickly and I didn't have time to ask for extra teriyaki sauce. 

30-40 minutes probably went by since being seated and my boyfriend didn't even get his sushi. We watched other tables getting their orders before us and even leaving before us! When his order finally came, his appetite was gone. We had enough of waiting and was just annoyed with out service. 

Overall, we give this place a 1 out of 5 stars. We had to ask 4 different times for lemon for our water and waited around 30-40 minutes for our food even though there was hardly anyone there. 

My boyfriend noticed that on the ayce paper menu it doesn't have a time limit like other sushi places. We concluded that if there was a time limit, then there wouldn't be any time left to order a second time.

The atmosphere is cute for sure. It is an order at the counter sort of place but their branding is nice and it doesn't feel like every other place in AZ. While I do think that's great, it wasn't even close to enough to bring up my review of the food. 

The food was not good. And not just mine ... nobody at our whole table particularly enjoyed their meal (and we are talking 10 people eating like 6 different things)? The burgers were under cooked and juicing out bloody burger juice. The veggies on the burgers didn't look or taste fresh. My chicken was super gristly and battered with the blandest batter I've ever had. The ribs were dry and mediocre. Even the kids barely touched theirs? It just wasn't a good experience. I know we sent back two burgers to be cooked longer but with how busy it was and the sorts of issues we were having, the rest wasn't even worth trying to fix. 

And the thing that made this all even worse is that this place isn't too cheap? If I want to have a crappy burger or chicken I'll go to McDonald's and spend $5 but just my boyfriend and I paid like $30 something bucks for food that we hated and were literally so hungry we ate another meal at another restaurant about an hour later? You can eat MUCH better for that money.

I will say their garlic fries were ok - definitely the best food on the table (which is kinda sad). And the chocolate shake was DELICIOUS. After trying mine, two other girls at our table ordered some. So I guess if you just want a shake and fries I recommend it but I travel to AZ often and I won't be back to this spot.",3.0,EuqJRbdBh85sm99CgzPzSA

SHORTS RIBS ($19):
http://bit.ly/2i0RwX7
This is by far the best braised short ribs I've had to date. 
This massive piece of boneless short rib was so juicy and fork tender. The rich velverty cabernet demi-glace was also quite delicious. The garlicky yukon gold mashed potatoes was velvety and smooth that I finished the whole thing (and I'm not a mashed potato fan at all, so that says a lot). Tis dish is a must-order. 

SEAFOOD SALAD TRIO ($20):
This was my half-ass lazy attempt at trying to be healthy while pigging out in Vegas....it had the word ""salad"" in it, so it counts. Yep...that's a fried tortilla on the side, lol! 
http://bit.ly/2hEyOUc
- The ""shrimp napoleon"" was basically 2 cocktail-styled jumbo shrimps butterflied and laid criss-cross over each other. Perfectly cooked shrimp, nothing fancy. 
- 2 slices of pepper seared tuna
- A spoonful of jumbo lump crab meat
The rest of the plate consisted of a couple pieces each of tomatoes, hearts of palm, prosciutto crisps and a scoop of avocado-kimchee slaw with ranch dressing. 

The bf and I split this deconstructed salad as an appetizer. 
It didn't look or sound like a lot of seafood, but it was definitely filling and something I wouldn't mind ordering again. 

FISH TACOS (2 tacos for $12.50): Fish of the day was mahi mahi. 
The bf fully enjoyed his plate of tacos. The cajun-spiced mahi was juicy and tender. The jack cheese, fresh cabbage, pico de gallo and ranch dressing was the perfect accompaniment to this filling plate of food. 

Our server that day was a hella fun guy name Randy. He was so bubbly and friendly, love him!

The breakfast burrito with carne asada was piping hot, the cheese was properly melted and the potatoes stayed warm down to the last bite. I'd say solid work on everything everything except the carne asada. A few too many pieces of meat were either too chewy or too fatty. Both salsas were fantastic. Red: smoky, balanced chipotle peppers, plenty of heat; Green: much more subtle in heat and flavor, but still worth putting a few splashes of it on parts of your burrito. I only wish they kept the salsas on ice, but having individual bottles to take to your table is also nice. At $4-4.50 for just eggs+potatoes and $6.50ish for eggs+steak, I think the portion size is just a hair too small. Don't get me wrong, it tastes fantastic and it was definitely filling, but other places don't mess around with portions. 

I'd say its a solid 4/5. I haven't had as much Tex Mex due to living in NE, so I might be overinflating, but I also think the carne asada could use some work. It all balances.",0.0,eRdQFwGEHvy4ifUYagzsTA

After paying, in my opinion, extortionate fees at another vets office. From the first moment I stepped in to the office, we were greeted by friendly receptionists. I am very diligent went it comes to my dogs, so this first visit was secretly an interview to see if the vets here would be deemed 'fit' to take care of my precious Boxers (I'm not kidding either ;). After that first appointment, I left feeling incredibly comfortable with my new choice of veterinary care. Having Boxers means we are there frequently!! We have seen pretty much all of the vets there and they all know my dogs well. The staff greet us by our names and with a huge smile. Sadly, we have been through some dire medical conditions and even had to have one of my senior boys who was suffering with cancer, put to sleep. Throughout that whole 2 month process, I feel as though we were treated with respect, love and most definitely a shoulder for support. I would arrive for the appointments every time, in tears and everyone was unbelievably nice and kind. They offer a service where you can opt for the vet to come to your home while you say goodbye to them, and this is what we chose (twice now) and each time the doctor (and Wes, the vet tech) were awesome. The place is staffed with a medical professional 24/7, therefore, on the occasion where one of my dogs might be required to  spend a night after a procedure, I know they are never left alone - something I absolutely could never allow! I am also a board member of a local rescue in town and we use CRAH as one of our veterinary choices for the dogs who come through the rescue. I have read some other reviews complaining of hidden charges etc and I can only say that from my personal (frequent) experience, every time we have been presented with 2 quotes - low end and high end, which is standard procedure with most vets in this town, and we were given an unpressured choice as to which additional procedures we wanted. I have explained many times that money is a huge issue for us, we don't have much therefore I need to keep costs as low as possible, however I don't want to cut out anything deemed necessary. I have never felt pressured or bullied or a bad ""mum"" when I have declined some services. As long as I have dogs, I will use CRAH to care for them. As a last note, after reading some of the negative reviews which are basically people complaining about having to pay for their animals medical costs, to them I say this, ""you own an animal by your own choice. The odds that at some point during its lifetime it will get sick or injured and need veterinary care, are extremely high. Either get pet insurance, or be prepared to pay for your animals well being, or, just don't get an animal if you can't afford to take care of it. Exams, X-rays, surgeries all cost money. Why do you expect to get it for nothing? Vets study for many, many years and don't earn that great a salary, which means they do this for their love of animals. They deserve to get paid, and you need to be respectful of that""",0.0,nmRrmgl2ef32-IDv3-VX1A

Unfortunately, I no longer had energy and desperately needed food. When I looked to my left I saw a fast-food building called Raising Cane's. Ever since that fateful day, I have been addicted.

Raising Canes has got to be one of my favorite fast food places for chicken! Their chicken fingers are always yummy, and the dipping sauce for them is so good. It adds a kick of flavor to each chicken finger, and tastes great with the fries and texas toast as well! My favorite thing about eating here has to be the texas toast. Please order extra, you will not regret this decision. If you don't care for coleslaw like me, you can ask them to trade it out for another piece of toast! It's so great! 

I definitely recommend coming here if you like cheap, but delicious fast food.",0.0,Nh-ztLj1IxS8ROHQqDFSiQ

The House Baked Pretzel was baked perfectly, allowing the dough to be light and soft. The cheddar fondue was the right amount of gooey-ness and was a delicious dip to the pretzel. The Wood Grilled Sausages were a good sampler of different types of sausages, which were all grilled to perfection, giving the sausages a smokey kick.

The Black Truffle Pizza had a good ratio of fontina and Parmesan, giving it a nice cheesy and stringy consistency, which is always nice to have with your pizza. The pizza was topped with slivers of truffles, which accentuated the delicious flavors of the cheese. But my personal favorite was the Fennel and Sausage flatbread. The flatbread was thing and crispy, while the sausage was very flavorful and had the right amount of saltiness that was noticeable with the notes of honey that was on the flatbread.

(the app made me select one to post) the complete bs I just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth. This is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn't caused by the food. I went with my family to this location for lunch. The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of ""I'm sorry!""s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store.

The entrance is separate from the main theatre and it's 18+ since they serve alcohol here.

You enter and you're in the lounge area which is complete with a bar.  They do have a small concession stand selling classic movie snacks (popcorn, candy, etc) but if you're dishing out for the VIP experience treat yourself and order from the bar.  They have a variety of appetizers and food like burgers so you could eat a full meal.  My boyfriend and I were there a little bit early so we ordered nachos and raspberry mojitos to enjoy in the lounge area.  The SCENE card gets you 10% off the food but not alcohol.  The other awesome thing about this place is the bathrooms.  They're all individual bathrooms and they're super clean. 

Seating inside the theatre is very comfortable and there are servers there to get orders and bring them to you up until the movie starts.  One thing I love about the VIP theatre is that they don't seem to show ads prior to the trailers and actual film.  That is always my biggest pet peeve about going to the movies.

Admission is quite pricey at $18.75 a person so you can be sure I won't be coming to the VIP theatre every time I go to the movies.  I would definitely do it though on the occasional night where I feel like treating myself.",4.0,UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w

I was looking at the base starting price!  After going in to the dealership to pursue this it was pointed out that the advertised price does not include mandatory dealer add on charges, such as window tinting (it was a used car and already on), nitrogen tires and other things that added up to over $1600. I guess it was on something I signed while getting to the desired monthly payment, but why wasn't it clearly pointed out?  And why dont I have any documentation or itemization of it in my loads of paperwork?  If I had in fact purchased these things I should have some sort of receipt for them. I think it's a horrible way to do business. We had verbally agreed on the advertised price and those add ons were glossed over and snuck in on top of that price. I have bought many used cars throughout my life and I have never ever run into this.  I will never again buy a car from a dealership who has mandatory dealer add ons.

The restaurant is not set up well for a smooth-flowing buffet line.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the direction the line should move, and I grew frustrated with the people who could not even make it through a buffet line without stopping to text.  What is wrong with people?  I imagined them texting the friend right behind them since nobody actually has real conversation any more.  And then when these chronic texters take the last of the tuna tartare?!?  Seriously? If you can't navigate a buffet line like a pro, you don't deserve the tuna tartare.

The service is sit down cafeteria style.    You write your table's order on an order pad and pay at the front counter.   The give you a table number and bring the food right out.    Very easy and low stress way to dine, though perhaps it may confuse some.

Tea and water are provided for free.   This restaurant is BYOB, and there's a nice liquor store next door.

PROS:   Amazingly authentic menu!   I've lived in China and traveled there extensively, and found many of my old favorites on the menu.   (A Chinese menu is posted on the wall with item numbers that correspond to the English language menus.)    I got to enjoy food I've haven't had in years and never thought I'd find in the US -- great stuff from several regions of China.    I also enjoyed some items that I hadn't had before, or had enjoyed in slightly different forms.   The crispy tofu for which this restaurant is so well-known is a fun item that everyone should try.   The pork bun is amazing!  Well-seasoned fatty deliciousness.    So many items to try.   I wish I lived in the area.

CONS:   None at all.   I hope this place never changes.",1.0,8fuigXbDDCE0JIDIpRG5Lg

If that's the case, they should be pulled off the menu until they are in season rather than hoping the waiter does the right thing.

The Trout Amandine was also dry and overcooked as well.  I had the Boudin Blanc which was actually pretty tasty, but I can make a damn fine sausage and mashed potato dinner at home that is just as good.

No doubt the prices are amazing and the people who work there are all really friendly and love their customers. 

I always order the same items:
Chicken fried rice - simple and amazing, the rice never sticks and is always delivered hot warm and so delicious. 
Egg rolls - they are really proud to serve them and they make them in-store I believe! Really delicious. 
Chicken balls - OMG without a doubt the best chicken balls! The batter is not too heavy or too light. The chicken to batter ratio is about 50/50 which is perfect! The chicken inside is always juicy and seasoned!
Chicken wings - simply deep fried and delicious. 
Lemon chicken - chicken is a must the batter is thick BUT very very crispy tasty batter, the sauce is decent but the chicken itself is legendary. 

This place is a Westernized Chinese food place, yeah it's gonna be greasy but coincidentally this place just nails it. Never have I received an order where there was a tone of grease in the boxes.

1. This is a nail school in a not so great part of town;
2. Because it is a school, the quality and consistency of the services is unreliable;
3. Don't buy the Groupon. Call the salon first, tell them you would like an appointment, and when they ask about Groupon, tell them you were going to buy one. This will ensure you get an appointment right away, as they can only do so many Groupons per day, and they will honor the Groupon price regardless;
4. The manicurists/students are all incredibly sweet and friendly;
5. This is a no frills, no massage chair salon (which I prefer as those massage chairs are filled with nasty, gross tubes filled with other peoples nail gunk that can never be cleaned out, ew).
6. Make sure you have time to burn, my mani/pedi took over two hours!
I decided to visit this salon because Groupon sent me an email advertising their Groupon. I was interested in the gel manicure and spa pedicure for $25, as it sounded like a very good deal. I called the salon before purchasing the Groupon to check their availability. The asked right away if I was calling with a Groupon, and whether or not I had purchased one yet. I indicated that I had not, and they said that was excellent, as they can only take so many Groupon customers per day, but that they would offer the Groupon price anyways if I just came in.
This salon is located in a not so fabulous part of town, but I would hardly classify it as ghetto. If this side of town is ghetto to you, you clearly have never been to a real ghetto before. The customer service that I experienced here was on par with any other salon. They were friendly when they greeted me, offered coffee or water, and were all smiles. The women who did my manicure and pedicure were both incredibly sweet, and their customer service was phenomenal. 
However, this IS A SCHOOL. As such, the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable. I had to wash and scrub my own nails, and my manicure left much to be desired. The gel is inconsistent, wrinkled, does not cover my whole nail, and the tips were left exposed. It is simply awful. I was very disappointed with my manicure. My pedicure, however, turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin. So it's really just a fluke whether or not your service will be good I suppose.
Since this is a school, the students work very slowly as they learn, so make sure you have time to burn. The whole mani/pedi experience lasted over two hours, and I had two women working on me at the same time. 
I decided to try this Groupon because of the neat pics of nail art other Yelpers had posted, but that was a mistake. Do not come here looking for anything other than solid color gel manicures, this is not the place.

Brought some Far East gold jewelry for an estimate.  None were stamped to exact gold content and many were unique items.  This made estimate difficult.

I saved the best restaurant for last and it didn't disappoint, in fact, the food and ambiance exceeded my expectations. It was really cool and fun to walk through the pawn shop into the restaurant. I loved seeing all the guitars on the wall.

Based on reviews, I started with the Tuna poke wonton tacos. I loved the presentation of the three tacos in a mini metal toast rack. The Tuna was fresh, spicy and flavorful and the tacos were crispy and crunchy. Simply divine!!

Based on the fabulous waitresses recommendation, I had the Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings. This dish blew my mind!! Creative and inventive cuisine that's artfully executed and presented. You get six dumplings served on individual lacquer Chinese spoons. The dumplings were delicious and bursting with flavor. I'd go back for this dish alone it was so good.

Next, I had the Cauliflower which was cooked and presented in a small stone or metal dish that kept the cauliflower warm. The vegetable was cooked in ginger salsa verde with pickled scallions and had the most unique and amazing flavor of any vegetable dish I'd ever had.

Sadly, I ate too much for lunch and was starting to feel full. I was desperate to try the Thai style deep fried shrimp or the Short rib mac and cheese which were both highly recommended and sounded delicious. Instead, I opted to splurge calorie wise and get the KYGO Cloud Nine ""S"" smores. I loved the creative presentation as the dish was topped with a giant marshmallow cloud. I found the marshmallow overly sweet and it overpowered the flavor of the dark chocolate torte below. 

The restaurant has a large, inventive cocktail list broken out into sweet and savory categories. There is an extensive wine list and about 4-5 wines by the glass in each category: sparking, white and red. I had several glasses of the Tempranillo. Prices ranged from $11-16 for most, which is really good value for Vegas where there are so many $18+ glasses.

Amazing atmosphere and service!! Best meal of the entire trip. I will be back in Las Vegas in January and this will be my #1 restaurant choice and I'm already dreaming of trying the Roasted bone marrow toast and Oven braised chicken meatballs and savoring every bite of the big wow grilled cheese dumplings.

Make this your #1 restaurant pick in Las Vegas. It's pure heaven for foodies!!",1.0,2A-Aagasek_HICoMPN3HSg

To make a long story short, Spencer needed another trip to the vet - an emergency appt. We called yesterday to get in today and they did it - no problem and no extra charge. We even switched times on them 3 times and they were pleasant and very accommodating about it.

The best part though was the staff and Dr. Stan Howard. He is great with animals and really knows his stuff. Spencer was thoroughly examined and then we even spent time discussing his diet and other concerns. 

Dr. Howard is very friendly and pleasant. He is a very happy person who really appears to enjoy his work. This time I got to scope out some more of his credentials and learned that he was educated partly at the University of Pennsylvania - a very prestigious college. 

I enjoyed my visit with him and he took care of Spencer - top notch! He knows a lot about Wheaten Terriers  and their special dietary needs and allergies. He also treats many of the show dogs in the area too, so he seems to know a lot about all the show breeds. After this visit, I felt very confident in trusting my dog's health care to him.

Spencer will soon be back (as soon as he heals) for his grooming and for the dreaded neutering. I hope after that visit I can give them 5 stars.

I brought in about 50 very gently used (some never worn)items. They were only used for my grandkids when they spent the night occasionally. I was told they were behind, call in 24 hours. I called back and found out they were only interested in paying me $1.26, two items. When asked they said they weren't interested because of fashion or condition . I later thought about it and realized I was donating summer clothes in October.  Slightly offended, I told them I disagreed but I would definitely be in to get my clothes to sell somewhere else. A few days later I come to retrieve my belongings only to find out that they have donated my clothes and tossed my storage bin. Now, I will admit I failed to read the fine print, but I do believe a simple verbal ""reminder"" when I reject the amount and let them know I will be in does not seem unreasonable. 24 hours from that conversation, I was told they put the clothes on their porch for a discounted rate to go to charity. I believe that it benefits them more to have clothes in front of their store to draw in customers than it does to have the people come back and pick up their belongings. It benefits them to not give you a friendly reminder. I was upset and surprised. The manager promised that the owner, Nick would be giving me a call to discuss my concerns.

From the oyster bar, to the appetizers, to our main entrees, we were very impressed with the food. The seafood was incredibly fresh and the fusion side dishes really complemented each of our meals. They apparently fly their fish in fresh every day (which you basically have to do if you are going to serve fresh seafood this far from the ocean).

There was a block long line outside on a Sunday morning to get a table for breakfast.  They were definitely efficient and had great service.  A lot of the breakfast menu items looked like they belonged on a dessert or ice cream parlor menu, rather than a diner. I had huevos rancheros.  The crumbled chorizo was salty enough to choke a horse and there was a lot of it, I wouldn't recommend it.  Another person with us had the breakfast burrito, which he said was overly filled with mismatched odds and ends.  He took the half he couldn't eat there and finished it later.  Our other companion had something else in a burrito and took half of that home also. In my opinion Deluca's needs to focus more on quality and less on quantity.

After some clumsiness at finding which service rep would check me in, I met Don Pagel, who is the foundation of the repair department. 
I needed some repairs done on my Silverado diesel, and gave Don a comprehensive list. He called the next morning with the list broken down bit by bit. 

When I explained I'd hoped to have the truck back in 3 days, he expressed that while he could probably do it, it wouldn't be as thorough as he'd like and would I accept the offer of a rental car at their expense, so they could do a thorough and clean job. 

They gave me a rental car, Eli was terrific to deal with. 

Throughout the next four days, Don emailed me each day with progress, and overall sharing that they were on-schedule. This guy is a complete pro from start to finish.

On pickup, he made the rental return as easy as ""didja scratch it?"", a quick walkaround, check of the fuel, and gave me the keys to my truck. 

My truck had been washed (I kinda wish they'd detailed the interior, it was quite dirty but also disorganized and I can't blame them for attacking this mess). 

Then, Don followed up with an email, and this morning followed up with a phone call. My experience at this Findlay property was in such contrast to my experience with their RV lot, I simply needed to share.

You can read about my RV experience at: https://www.yelp.com/biz/findlay-rv-las-vegas?hrid=8BMTgU2mXlFOEhle3rMxKA

I went into this location after being told over the phone that they had a brake special of 50% off services. That was a lie.

I take my car in the next day and as I was waiting, I overheard a customer telling the men at the front desk her brand new brakes she just purchased and had installed at this Meineke were grinding and making an awful noise. (I should have left then, considering I too needed brake service). I made the mistake of staying.

My car is looked at by one of the ""mechanics""who calls my boyfriend and I outside to tell us the quote, I see a quote for $997. How brakes and one rotor costs nearly $1000 is beyond me. But the quote wasn't the worst part. 

After I clearly disagree with the charges and opt to take my vehicle somewhere else, the man proceeds to tell me, he will not allow me to drive my vehicle away due to the condition of my brakes, and I would have to tow my car off their shop. They claim it's the law. However when I sign a waiver I assume all responsibility of my car and I also make it clear I am aware of the supposed danger of my vehicle. Meienke was not abiding by law they were trying to waste my time, after I disagreed with their bogus charges. Obviously they use this tactic as a way to get fools to just stay and have the services done there. I didn't and as soon as I said I still did not want brake services done there, the nice guy act went out the window. They were very rude and  condescending to me as I waited for the tow truck to arrive.


I would never bring my car here again. These are not true mechanics. They are just a bunch of men who take advantage of unsuspecting people by charging them more money than their services will ever be worth. Do yourself a favor and never visit this or any other Meineke store. Terrible service, and a terrible experience is all you will get when coming here, trust me.",1.0,N5IrD6Nber0Jsr5I1-HdOg

Especially since I had gotten pregnant and had experienced a few weeks worth of morning (all day long) sickness.  Well this past Friday, she finally twisted my arm enough into going.  

I've had Pho at a lot of different restaurants.  I've had Pho so much so, that I got burnt out on it a few years back.  Hence, my reason for not really wanting to check this place out.  You've had one Pho, you've had'em all.  

We both ordered the Pho ga ca rau xanh (Pho chicken, broccoli, and baby bok-choy)

The noodles were about par for pho noodles.  The broth was as standard as any pho broth.  There was hardly any broccoli and baby bok.  You're paying .75 extra for broccoli and bok, so I expect to see quite a bit in my pho.  Also, they only brought out 1 small plate (about the side of a bread plate) for the two of us to split of the bean sprouts, lime, chili pepper, and thai basil.    You'd think if both of us are ordering pho, we'd BOTH get a plate.  I will say though, the bowl was huge.  After having a few spoonfuls of the broth and bites of noodles, I ended up just eating the broccoli, bok, and most of the chicken.

We split an order of the spicy pork vietnamese springrolls.   Now, those were awesome!  The rolls were nice and stuffed.  The dipping sauce that they come with, spicy and slightly sweet.  Throw some chili paste on them and they're perfect!  If I had known that the pho would have been such a disappointment to me, I would have ordered the springrolls as my entree.  

Will I return?  I think so.  But just to get an order of the spicy pork springrolls.  :)",2.0,b34yOQoUDev_l6BzDBMpUQ

As the main course I ordered a grilled angus striploin steak, prepared medium rare close to the rare side and served with perfectly grilled vegetables. The steak was a little chewy but it must have been just a piece like that because it was perfectly prepared. Sun dried tomato and butter topping gave a steak a wonderful touch.

There is running, gym/training, skiing, yoga, and general outdoors apparel. I love all of their clothes and appreciate the quality Athleta offers. Their twist hoodies are perfect for running, I love their sports bras, and their pants are comfortable to workout in as well as flattering. 

I am a loyal fan of the twist hoodies and will most likely end up buying every color. They fit very close to the body, have awesome sweat wicking material and also boast being ""anti-stink"" therefore you can wear their clothes longer before having to wash - which is convenient as well as eco-friendly.  Another thing I love about Athleta is their guarantee to their customers, one can take off the tags, work-out in the clothes, and if not happy for any reason can return the items no questions asked. I think they call it their sweat guarantee.  I read about a woman who accidentally threw her yoga pants in the dryer after owning them a year. She took them to the store to ask how to remove the pilling that happened and they told her to just get a new pair, on them.

Price: the food was really overpriced, everything was about 5$ too expensive.

The taste: The all important taste test. I am a burger guy for sure, so I ordered the Black Label Burger. The composition was ok... They put the vegetables on the side, so the cheddar cheese sticks to the bun which makes it hard to pull apart. I think the burger may have under-seasoned because it had little flavor other than the bacon and unseasoned beef. They also don't pat the bacon dry before putting it in the burger, and the burger was really juicy, which is a good thing, but it ended up being very greasy and soggy by the end.

Out of the 3 KBBQs I've been to in Las Vegas, this is the only AYCE where the servers actually come around and cook your meat for you which is convenient. They have a decent grade of meat and there's a variety to order from. 

The banchans are nicely seasoned and they usually bring out Jun (korean pancake) and some cheesy corn (which I still don't understand why you would eat Korean food with cheesy corn) to place on the grill. They also bring you plenty of kimchi and kong-namul (bean sprouts) which they'll grill for you to enjoy with the meat.

At the end of your meal definitely ask for the fried rice (I think it's a little extra). They'll add rice, eggs, veggies, and whip you up some kimchi fried rice with whatever meat you still have grilling. Yum!

As this was the first AYCE KBBQ I discovered in Las Vegas, I would come here until I discovered Tofu Hut. Honey Pig is a bit pricier (over $25 I believe for dinner) where Tofu Hut is $17 and also comes with my favorite steamed egg and bean paste soup.

We've been twice.  The first time was right after they opened.  We approached the hostess stand to the right (if you're standing in front of the restaurant) and the girl snarled, ""You need to put your names in over there,"" pointing to the other hostess stand to the left (basically just a counter where menus were spread out).  Okay.  Our visit that time was unremarkable - nice waiter, good food, really dead for a place that just opened.

It was the second visit this weekend that solidified my opinion.  Wouldn't ya know, we approached the ""correct"" counter this time and stood there waiting.  And waiting.  And... waiting.  A hostess approached... no, she diverted to the right-hand stand and began counting out her drawer.  After a couple minutes I cleared my throat, she looked up and said, ""Um, are you dining in?""  I said, ""Yes, we were hoping to, but we've been standing here for almost ten minutes.""  Not even the grace for a perfunctory apology, she grabbed two menus and stalked into the restaurant.  I assumed we were meant to follow her, so we did.  Big mistake!

We ordered two apps (garlic edamame and eggplant fries, both good) and three rolls (two of which were very good).  I don't know what to say about the third roll, a baked roll, because it never came.  We waited and waited... our waitress disappeared.  She finally showed up and we asked for the check, which of course, included the missing roll.  We explained that we didn't receive it and asked her to take it off the check.  She was embarrassed, very nice, about it, but explained that ""the first one got burned and they are trying to make you another one.""  Really, 30 minutes after our food came out?  And no one was going to tell us unless we asked?  There were literally three other occupied tables in the restaurant.  The bartender was eating a pretzel.

There's currently a storm rolling through town (remnants of Hurricane Bill) so their outside seating was partially closed. The inside was alive and full of energy. 

We placed our reservations via their website, when we walked in and our reservation was right there. They are on their game. Our waitress, Cathy, was very friendly, professional and attentive. 

Appetizer of small sampler platter and grape leaves were incredible. For our main meal, I had the chicken sampler over rice with grilled pepper, while my wife had the Turkish lamb chops over rice, both were wonderful; there were no leftovers. For dessert, we split their rice pudding (and I'm a sucker for rice pudding). 

Near the end, the owner stopped by to see how we enjoyed dinner. He asked if we tried the baklava, and when he heard we hadn't, he went back to the kitchen and brought out two small pieces, perfect for sampling. Needless to say, it, too, was amazing. 

If I had one complaint it would be the fact that parking is at a premium in that location. We found a spot around the corner on a residential street.  Just take care not to block a driveway or park in front of a hydrant. Not that big of an issue, I was able to walk off the baklava after dinner. 

Thank you for a great experience and an even better dinner. We'll definitely be back... I already miss the sampler platter.",1.0,ZQWpd0LhazVbZ1gyXe0Ncg

Attentive staff and manager
Poor food

Let me say the people are great! The staff really care for their patrons and it is greatly appreciated. 

Unfortunately the food is not up to par as the location and design. Coming here for a quick beer and getaway, I order the pizza bites as a way sample their dough. 4 pizza pockets for $6 dollars seems reasonable but as I ate, I found that it was unfortunately not worth the money. The bottoms are soggy and the chef even had the gall to place a pizza pocket that was hallow. I understand that the chef is new, but that is unacceptable. I mean, I hate to say this, but hot pocket does a better job than this sad Appetizer.

I was really excited because a lot of beauty bloggers talk about blow dry bars and I definitely cannot achieve a good blow out on my own. This wasn't the worst, but it could have been a lot better. Everyone was really sweet and professional, but honestly, if I knew my hair was going to be half-a** blow dried and then curled with a straightener, I would have done it myself. My hair is really long and my stylist used a 1"" straightener and PULLED SO HARD to curl my hair, leaving these juvenile spin-y curls. It's just not flattering for long hair. I was hoping to have it styled with the brushes and less so with any hot irons. Also, I watched my styled literally put 4 products in the palm of her hand before into my hair. FOUR! That's not right. I am giving three stars because the service itself was great, but the techniques were poor. I'd actually be willing to go back again (because I hate blow-drying my hair) and try conveying my vision better. But y'all. Come on. Long hair needs beach waves or big curls.

And here is the reason why... We recently moved to Mountain's Edge and were in search of a new groomer for our 2 dogs (Dachshund terrier and Poodle mix). We saw the reviews for this place were good so decided to give it a try. They called us back in the expected time frame (about 5 hours). The dogs seemed fine and groomed. They did miss a couple of areas for our Dachshund (they missed his left ear and chest), but we didn't have any major complaints so we decided to take them again a few months later. The next time we went, it was my sister who paid and picked-up the dogs. When she was paying the tip for the groomer, the check-out girl saw the amount of tip and gave my sister a nasty look and asked if that was all the tip she was giving the groomer. My sister thought $30 for 2 small dogs for a simple hair and nail trims were enough (I have to mention that they are both well behaved dogs, and we have never had any complaints or problems with groomers, vets or people) And even if the tip wasn't enough, the girl should have not given her a dirty look and judged her. Ever since then, my sister refuses to take our dogs and her own dog to Barking Dogs. Not only because she was personally offended, but because she was afraid that they were going to mistreat our dogs for what they considered a ""not enough"" tip. The total for the 2 dogs was $90. We tipped more than 30%. We are now driving all the way back to our original groomer, Petiquette, where the owners and staff are friendly and they don't judge you for how much you tip, and where our dogs are well groomed and taken care of.",1.0,hsJLv8er94o9S_6Z9w-nHw

Not just bland red syrup.  I put a little on the rice to liven in up a bit.  (Worked)

My compatriots only complaint with his Kung Pao Chicken was that is was not spicy enough.  I think that they could probably make it spicier next time if requested.  Amazing food, prompt delivery,  will be eating here again.",0.0,NiACIXzTdDMNNErMekLuiw

Went here with a group of friends. I made the reservation on a Sunday and didn't really feel like I needed it as it wasn't too busy. Got sat down quickly and our friends slowly started arriving.

The wings are a little bit more pricey than other wing nights elsewhere around the city but perhaps it's because of their selection and gluten free options! Either way I definitely think its worth it. The wings were a great size, not too small and not on steroids. They do have drummettes with the wings too so they are not ALL wings in case you were wondering.

I ordered salad too with my order. Neat concept where you are able to pick whatever unlimited free toppings! This was awesome as I don't see too many places do this and the serving size was definitely for sharing! Some toppings are a buck or two. The dressings were great too!

My salad was an Above Average Salad instead of the normal mix of greens the base of salad was marinated Kale and the other components of the salad were roasted cauliflower , currants and Marcona Almonds dressed perfect not too much .

My boyfriend, his best friend, and I decided to check this place out after finding out the AYCE Chinese Buffet next door turned into a Dim Sum a la carte restaurant. The place was fairly cramped with the booths real close to your gut. It was almost like my man boobs were actually sitting on the table when we were done. We all decided to get the AYCE sushi dinner (1 hour time limit), which was fairly priced.

The service was fast and so was the sushi that came from the sushi bar for the first 15 rolls. Most of the flavors seemed to have originated from Korean style, Kim chee especially the ahi poke. 90% of the rolls that came to the table were drenched or overly sauced. When I go to a Japanese restaurant, I expect my sushi to come out fresh, with natural flavors. So all the sauces on these rolls today, is masking the low quality fish.

The last 5 orders depreciated the ratings of this place.  They should watch the quality of all their products, especially the ""mini beef platter"", the meat tasted past due. So guess who had the runs for the past day and a half? So I didn't know if the meat was actually meant to be on the fermented side, cause the whole Korean influence, or they were trying to sneak away with serving the meat til it was sold out so their food cost wouldn't be so high. There was a sushi roll that had corn and grilled onions on top of it, like who does that? With over powering, mayo based sauce drenching the rolls underneath, It would be awesome if all their rolls came with a description of what's inside or on top, My boyfriend is allergic to tomatoes, citrus, and onions. So then my ramen came out. I was thinking it would be a homemade ramen noodle, with a nice broth. Nope, top ramen, Kim chee flavored, with a sprig of green onion, dusted with more Kim chee seasoning!

If. It weren't for the e.coli infested beef tips, the drenched and soggy rolls, the mediocre tempura ice cream, and the southwestern, over kill on the onions on top of the sushi, or the imitation ramen, I'd given this whole in the wall a higher rating!",1.0,eMwXdbCwnXgNpvEAttH3-w

I love their food! Their food is great but my last 2 visits (1 to the Riverview location and most recently the Higley location) left me extremely disappointed due to menu changes and inflexible customer service. 

A few months ago at Riverview, I requested to make a substitution in an item that came with a new meal offering of their's that I wanted to order. My server told me it was not possible. (I'd like to note the young man was not my regular server, an awesome lady from Crotia who's terrific at her job!) The item I wanted sold a la carte for the same price as the item included in my meal. I even offered to pay a buck or two upcharge in order to get what I wanted but the server refused. I asked to speak with a manager several times but one never came to my table. I ordered something else and continued my request to speak with a manager who never came despite my server's reassurance that he would. I haven't been back since. 

Today, I stopped at the Higley location, ordered a burro with a side of sour cream and a drink. I've ordered this burro by itself numerous times over the past several years (most recently last month) but today I was told it now comes with choice of beans or rice. They could not sell me just the burro. After much insistence that I did not want either, a lady working behind the counter told cashier and me that I didn't have to take the side but they couldn't adjust the price. I thought she might offer to comp my side of sour cream or my drink in exchange; but no such luck. So, $10.69 for a burro and a drink! I just find it difficult to spend hard-earned money and either not be able to get what I want or feel taken advantage of.

We ordered the red dragon, rainbow, black dragon, spicy salmon, salmon ginger wasabi roll and one assorted tempura. (We also got complimentary enoki beef rolls because they messed up an order!) Oh, and I can't forget the complimentary miso soup and ice cream. 

All of this came up to a sweet $58 and some. 

Obviously the quality can't be compared to Guu down the street.. But still quality sushi regardless. The rolls could be a little more creative, but it's not a big deal. The ingredients still mingled. Presentation wise.. Well honestly when you pay for fast service and cheap quality food.. Who cares!  Avocado was bang on (total pet peeve when they're not fresh or browning), portions were reasonable and sashimi was fresh. 

Service is always fast at this place. The only thing I dislike about Sushi on Bloor is the ""waiting area"" in the front. It often gets busy and results in a 10-15min wait for a table. People often line up in this tiny corridor between the inside/outside doors.. It gets way too congested and makes me feel super impatient with all the people brushing past me. Stop shoving me!!

One side is the coffee side.  It opens for those who need an early coffee and maybe a pastry.  They also offer a simple menu of oatmeal, egg/bacon or sausage or what they call their ""Big Ass"" Burrito.  They also have a ""Small Ass"" Burrito if you're not that hungry.  The coffee is their own and  is roasted on the premises.  I love the smell of it when I drive through the town.  Their coffee offerings are equal to what you would find at Starbuck's but they also have some items unique to them.  Their ""Mocaffe"" (Mexican spiced hot chocolate) is one of my faves.

The wine side is open for lunch/dinner time.  The menus are small, and most items would be considered appetizers.  However, the menu is unique enough that you feel like you are getting a little something special. It's always fun to make a meal of apps. Good sandwiches too. They also do a decent pizza.

Monday nights, they offer a $5 price on many of their wines.  It's a good time to try some labels that maybe you aren't used to.

I harbor no ill will towards Pac East, in fact, I like the sushi here a lot. I've just, well you know... had better. Not that we have a plethora of amazing sushi places to choose from in the CLE (hello, Lake Erie), but I do think we have some better choices. One is right up the street! 

Pacific East got voted ""Best in Cleveland"" a few years in a row or something. Cool. I mean, I definitely think the food is great. I've never had bad sushi or service. I've even had lots of take-out that was tasty when I got it home. 

Some things in particular that I like: 

1) Thank you Pacific East for your low prices. You make eating healthy, tasty sushi on a budget possible. Especially back when I literally had barely enough money to live. Yum.

2) Fast, friendly service. I know I can always hit up Pac East for a quick bite to eat before I have to go do something else. 

3) Good quality food that is consistent. Nothing is worse than varying dishes that you love the first time around, but the second just sucked. 

The only downside I can see about Pacific East is really just the parking situation on Coventry. There's limited street space, I never have change for the dang meters in the garage, and the Cleveland Heights police department loves to write parking tickets.

I've always driven past it and wondered what it was like, but since she gave it such a great review, I thought I'd give it a go. 

The restaurant has a sort of Parisian cafe feel to it, with mismatched chairs and some booths and tables, and a mural on the wall. Upon arrival mid-Saturday afternoon, we were also presented with 3 menus, breakfast (which was ending shortly), sandwiches and another menu which appeared to be dinner options, priced $16 - $24 range. My friend and I both selected from the sandwich menu. 

I ordered the BLT, but having noticed that they served peameal bacon for breakfast, asked if I could have peameal on my BLT, they obliged, no problem. My friend ordered the meat loaf sandwich and we both ordered the sweet potato fries. 

Service was fast, there were only 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant. I was expecting an average sandwich, didn't really figure you can screw up a BLT, er...thought wrong. The peameal was overcooked, and very dry, and it was served on 'white' bread, no egg or challah bread to be found here!! I was disappointed. The whole sandwich was dry, I asked for mayo, and the waiter said there was already mayo on it, I opened it up and the thing was bare. I showed him, and said, ""Umm, actually there's not..."" (awkward...) 

My friend's meatloaf sandwich was a mess!! First she had asked for no onions, was allergic to them, and upon receiving the sandwich, had to proceed to pick off somewhere in the range of 7-8 pieces of red onion off of her sandwich!! The problem with the sandwich was just that it was a complete mess. It was on a regular bun, and gravy was poured over the meatloaf and the other half of the bun was placed on top. On service, the bottom part of the bun, is soaked, drenched in gravy, making it impossible to pick up! It was just a mess, I think it would be a much more successful item choice if perhaps it was served as an open faced meat loaf sandwich, with the gravy in a boat on the side that you pour on yourself at the time you are going to eat it, so that the bottom bun doesn't disintegrate. 

As if our food quality wasn't bad enough while we were attempting to salvage a meal out of it, our entertainment was listening to our waiter bicker with the other waitress about table assignment and allocation of tips and how unfair she had been. The disagreement got quite heated and their voices were raised, creating quite a bit of tension in the restaurant amongst the customers, or at least, that was my perception. 

Overall, I was not impressed with the food or the service of this restaurant. I would not recommend it. I will not be returning to try their breakfast or brunch, or even to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, that was my very first and last visit. You know what they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.",2.0,2ALvr58dp4Of65TZ8SCz3w

The Food: Fantastic. But oddly, whenever we eat AT the restaurant, the food is rave-ingly good. It seems when we take it to go, we've gotten dry, unimpressive meals a few times. Not sure what that's about.

I love that they use the broccoli stalks rather than the heads. Definitely cuts the gas factor down for me.

My favorite meals:
* Crispy Fried Fish ($11.95) - Non-fishy tasting catfish in an awesome coconut curry sauce...mmmm...Ironically, the fish is NOT crispy but who cares?
* Just tried the Pad-See-Yew Noodles last night ($8.95) and I looooooooooooooooooooved it. The noodles were buttery tasting and the fried tofu (you can choose from tofu, beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, scallops, squid, or seafood combo) was a great firmish consistency.
* Thai Egg rolls ($2.50 for 2) - Yummy but they contain chicken and now that I'm vegetarian, can't have 'em.
* Fried Rice is yummy and fresh... Comes with cucumbers and tomatoes which is kind of weird but refreshing.

There's always plenty leftover for another tasty meal manana. The customer service is cordial and friendly.

The Bad:
1) Closed Mondays (weird day to close)
2) No website (in this day and age, there is no excuse for this. No one says you have to get all fancy and post the menu and stuff but even if you just put up 1 cheap page with your name, logo, address and directions...)
3) A few issues with takeout quality
4) The mounted flat screen kind of kills the ambiance.",3.0,XjZOiH4yOYnzeu4hkaatxg

There is street parking only, so take it when you can get it!  Also, although the street sign says East Railroad Street, those of us from the South Hills know this road as Washington Pike coming from Bridgeville and Washington Ave coming from Carnegie.

After getting the bill we had to sit around even more waiting for her to get it and return our card. This is the loss of the 2 stars as poor service can ruin an experience

The food was pretty good though. My carne asada was very moist and very flavorful. I was able to make a burrito with it as they serviced it with chorizo beans, rice, and guacamole and sour cream and a tortilla. They also served some potatoes with it but they were meh at the best.

 - you pay before your stay
 - the rooms have numeric keypad entries like houses can have. So remember to lock your door when you leave! We didn't realize this initially
 - the suites with kitchenettes are handy, modern, but very ikea. 
 - the rooms are incredibly hot. The little home sized air conditioning unit doesn't quite do the trick.

My experience with Arepa is limited...  aside from having the Venezuelan style  Arepa at Arepa Cafe http://www.yelp.ca/biz/arepa-cafe-toronto#hrid:Pxplj67nbkQA-VCbm8_93w/src:self which I thoroughly enjoyed. 

When my Yelp Friend suggested Arepiando, I am IN!

Prices wise, Arepiando's Arepa is almost half of what Arepa Cafe is charging... but the location of course matters a lot!! Arepiando is located in a Latin American area up in North York, while Arepa Cafe is down in Queen St West. The set up of Arepiando is more like a takeout place where you can watch the cook/cashier/owner preparing your arepa through the glass window.

Arepiando might serves really authentic Colombia Arepa, but I didn't enjoy the white corn arepa as much, I found that it was just too crunchy and chewy.  Since in Colombia, Arepa usually eaten as Breakfast or Afternoon snacks, so most of the Arepa here at Arepiando has cheese and eggs as the main ingredients!

My Yelp Friend decided on: 

Arepa con Chicharron ($5) - Fried Pork Skin with Cheese
- So chewy... so dried... I am glad I still have all my teeth if not I won't be able to eat the pork... but I might have problem digesting it though
- taste wise, it was pretty bland, the hot sauce on the side was pretty weak, I tried to dip it in the dressing.....

Arepa Ranchera ($4) - Eggs with Chorizo and Cheese
- definitely a breakfast sandwich.. the scrambled eggs were really fluffy but unfortunately the sausages were on the dry side

Lulo Juice Cocktail ($1.50) and Strawberry Soda ($1.50)
- My first experience with Lulo was good which has a citrus flavour
- My friend's Strawberry Soda tasted just like cough syrup!! But he like cough syrup!

The lady was so nice, even gave us a chicken empanada to try... but the empanada was meh too... bland and dry...

My wife and I were in Vegas looking for good Italian food. We searched Yelp and other resources and decided we wanted to try this restaurant. 

Our journey: this is not the restaurants fault, but worth noting. Not knowing how to get to this establishment we relied on the directory. BIG MISTAKE. no joke it took us 20 min to find this place. After asking, and looking at several directories ( that show ""you are here"" backwards from where you really are). At one point my wife and I were tempted to just eat any place, but it became a game to find this restaurant. Once here it was smaller than expected and kind of exposed to the mall. But we were happy to find it! 

The service was superb! Wish I remembered our waiters name. A younger Italian gentleman. Super nice, checked on us at all the right times. Overall very good service. 

Food: we both had Caesar salads that were very good. I had chicken parmesan which was great and my wife had chicken Marsala. It was honestly very good food. 

Our bill came and it was ""cheap"" for Vegas, around $80 or so. Considering we had great service and good food I put $120 bucks in the binder and we finished our drinks. Our waitress took the bill, asked if we needed change and I said no you're all set. 2 min later he walked pasted us and thanked us which was nice.

Didn't look like much but me being the way I am insisted on trying it. Apparently it's everything I ever dreamed of: asian buffet (good quality food as opposed to the crap you find on most asian buffets), and ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI!

When I found out about the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI I kinda felt unnerved at the idea, presuming it would most likely be pretty gross. Man was I ever proved wrong. I have eaten in a lot of Toronto's sushi joints and this place definitely has some of the best sushi in town.

As for the environment it is very clean. Washrooms are beautiful. Servers are all very nice when you can get their attention. Though they have gotten better. When we first started going in we were some of their first customers so we got astounding service. When the pace started to pick-up though we noticed the quality of service diminish. But they have made some good improvements. They're a new business so I'll give them a break this time I guess.

If there were any quirks about the place I'd have to point out it would be their hilarious selection of music. Some nights you will go in and it will be good ol asian music straight through. But other times we have been in there you get the classic asian music mixed with unbelievably random songs ranging from forgot about dre (Dr. Dre and Slim Shady) to what I think was a bootlegged Iron Maiden song. 

All in all one of my favourite spots in the city if your looking for a good meal for an awesome price.

Speaking of price, lunch is from 1100-1600 and costs $10 for the buffet. After 1600 its $14. On weekend add $2 to both of those prices.

Also, Oishi Sushi was just recently licensed to serve liquor and their beer is dirt cheap at less than $4 a bottle (domestic)!!!

If your ever up in the Downsview area be sure to hit this place up. Would recommend over any Wasabi and maybe even over the Mandarine with Oishi Sushi introduction of Crab Legs to their dinner buffet!",6.0,mksFinlYC_bDrc1k7VTG9w

Overall, food was prettttty good, but service was lacking for what the price of the restaurant. Service felt a bit disorganized. 

Let's start with their complimentary Baguette with jam and butter. Love their baguette - light, crisp, and perfect with their jam. I could just eat this for the meal. Cheese platter was one of the best I've had - it came with cow, sheep, and goat cheese; hard, medium, soft; mild, semi pungent. My favorite was the truffle cheese - oh man, the truffle flavor was strong. Along with the cheeses were honey comb, walnut, sliced apples, and delicious bread crisp with dried fruits. Pair the sweet offerings with the Cheese, it was a perfect flavor medley in the mouth. 

Moving onto my Omlette Du Jour - I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting a fluffier omlette, but I think my eggs were a bit over cooked. French Onion Soup was divine - the soup was reduced, the caramelized onion flavor really shined through, a bit salty as French Onion soup tends to be, cheese was perfect.",16.0,xqybfWaTzzst2ZlpWCjUNA

Went for dinner 22 April. Everything was fine up until the part where people actually eat, which is a major issue being a restaurant. Two distinctly different dishes were ordered; yellow curry with tofu and Seafood Delight. Hers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I told her to not wait for me and eat, believing my order would be coming out shortly.

Meanwhile, a table of two came in, and was seated at a table that was in my line of sight. They got their drinks, ordered and started to eat

Every so often, staff would peek around to see me, sitting there not eating. Eventually, one of the waitresses comes over.

""Is everything okay?
Everything except I haven't received my order.""

Minutes later...

""Is everything okay?
Is there something wrong in the kitchen? I'm still waiting for my food.""

Her response was that the order slipped through the cracks because of a larger party's (20+) order, which doesn't sound right. The party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in, and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating. Additionally, our order was taken on one ticket, not two (2) separate orders, so both orders should have been started at the same time

My plate finally shows up, but I'm so upset that I don't eat. For five minutes, I debate whether or not to ask for the manager. And again, every so often the staff would peek around to see me, sitting there and not eating. Was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave.

We had finished our meals. The male waiter shows up, and asks how things are going. She had asked for a to go container, which was brought promptly. She filled the container with her leftovers, and the dishes were taken away.

We sat around for another 15 minutes. No one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check. That table of two? Already out the door. While we were waiting, we had a talk about her talking with management, because I knew she would be calmer than I would be. We go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay, but we never received a bill.

""What table was yours?
The table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner.""

At that point, I pulled $25 out of my pocket, and handed it to her while taking her take out container. Was so livid that I told the hostess that she had something to say to management and I had to leave

She finally came out, and I got the lowdown.

- A lot of apologies were given, but no real action to correct the situation (Which I take as, no one cares enough to follow up)
- Of the three wait staff (2 F, 1 M) who came to our table, not once did the male member mention he was the manager
- Lots of finger pointing going around: waitress(es) believed since the manager came over, he would take care of us; manager believed waitress(es) was still serving us.",2.0,hHhSmytOPwOfbsIPQrbtzg

1. LIES, DAMN LIES - The employees will lie to you, without a doubt.  I have lost count of the number of times I have been lied to while living here.  We were lied to about the ability to get satellite TV installed, about the state of our apartment on moving in, about regularity of the bus (forget it when school is not in session), the safety of the place, and about so much more.

2. FEES WITHOUT SERVICES - The Village has no qualms about charging a fee for a service they do not provide.  We sublet initially and were told we would have to pay a redecoration fee and would have to leave at least two days between the prior tenant's move-out and our move-in so they could ""redecorate"". When we arrived, of course, the place had not been cleaned let alone redecorated.  When we asked about this, we were told that they never redecorate in sublet situations.  You should not be surprised to hear that the sublessor was not refunded her redecoration fee and neither were we.  In addition, a number of friends were assessed charges for things they had not done, including fines for leaving trash out.  Very questionable behavior.

3. CRIME - Numerous cars had their back windows shot-out while I have been living here, at least three by my count.  The Village refused to do anything in response. 

4. THERE ARE NO SOCCER FIELDS OR BASKETBALL COURTS BEHIND THE VILLAGE - When we signed up, we were shown a nice diagram of Colbert park with all of its facilities, including a soccer field, a basketball court, and an amphitheater.  These things do not exist.  There is some grass and a hill, but it takes some imagination to conjure up what the Village subtly advertises. 

If you're the kind of person who is willing to forgive all manner of misbehavior in exchange for a pool and pizza party every once in a while then by all means move in here.

As a final note, both the Village drivers and maintenance staff are perfectly friendly and seem competent enough.  This review is limited to a critique of the management and office staff who ought to be ashamed of their behavior.",11.0,3ejCVkymBB2qjGP3YNRwPA

Now in regards to the food, a single mimosa shows on the menu as $5.95 but the actual price on the ticket was $6. That may not seem like a lot but when they sell thousands that adds up.

The food was plates nicely and was in good portions. I have found that some other AYCE places make their maki rolls smaller than regular, that's not the case here. I didn't feel they were trying to cheap out on their AYCE orders. Although we weren't given an option for a regular menu I would imagine you don't have to do AYCE if you don't want too. But at $19 it's a good value since other in the area go up to $22.

I'd love to say that it's great but it would be far from the truth. For starters it is far smaller and they have half of there home decor items hanging on the wall half way around the store above all of the shelves so if you want anything you have to walk around basically starring at the ceiling just to look. If you actually find anything you want before you give up looking because your neck starts to hurt then you have to find an employee who knows how to get it down( I say this because it took 4 employees to figure out what they needed to do to get one picture down for me). While I understand that lack of room is not necessarily there fault but it is still frustrating and inconvenient. My second issue is with a specific cashier shanna. I come here multiple times a week as I have a small business on the side so I shop for specific items when they are 50% off so most of the things I get each trip are all on sale. The last 3 times I've checked out with shanna and every single time I'm not sure what she does( or doesn't do) but she might apply the discount to some things or other things that aren't even on sale, so my total is never correct. 2 of the 3 times she rang  everything up then said your total is x amount...

1/5 for the staff/office
4/5 for Dr. Rebecca Tyre....I figure doc should carry more weight than staff...

Why 1/5 for the staff/office?
1. Staff is very unfriendly. REALLY unfriendly. I read some poor reviews before going in and I thought, well, I'll kill them with kindness. Entirely unsuccessful. Front desk staff pretty much avoided any sort of eye contact, and will flat out refuse to talk to you until they call you up...in fact, I had to go up three times over 1.5 hrs to find out they were having issues with my insurance. 

2. The wait is INSANE. I had a 9AM appointment. How does a 9AM appointment run over 1.5 hrs late?

3. Seriously, are they not allowed to smile?

There is minimal explanation of what happens. They also get very annoyed with you when you are unable to read their mind and herd  yourself to the correct cubicle to find the correct PA/nurse.

4/5 for Dr. Tyre.
The interaction with Dr. Tyre was surprisingly pleasant. She was friendly and comforting, which I feel is an important characteristic in an OB/GYN. The only reason I am taking 1 star off is because I was recommended a redo of a certain test in 6 mo to confirm something...which seemed completely reasonable...until my friends that are practicing OB/GYNs elsewhere told me that's really not the standard of care. I understand and definitely appreciate the sentiment to rule out certain things...but I'm also a firm believer in following standard of care and avoiding excessive testing.  

Overall, because the office was so terribly unpleasant, I doubt I will be returning.",7.0,1rhmtfH_D7HBIzndwX91tA

It's not that I expect friendly service from the person working at the counter but when your place is named ""Aloha"" Kitchen, you'd think someone can crack a smile and say hi when they take your order.  It's just not one time, it's consistently like this, no greeting at all!   

The food is alright, I do give credit that they plate the food attractively, but they rely too much on drowning their meats in sauce for flavor instead of seasoning and marinating it.  The slices of beef that did have no sauce were a little dry & tasteless.  The manapua I ordered was a store bought brand and the dough was a bit tough. (like they left it cooking in the microwave a little too long) . That's probably why you get your food real quick!! It's already been prepared all they do is reheat it!

The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that I think I love China Way (see my other review) more and its more authentic I believe. Everytime I have been to Pei wei though, I have not be disapointed. I have several favs. The honey seared chicken is amazing, as are the Pei Wei spicy beef, lettuce wraps, and Dan Dan noodles. The orange beef , pad thai, and chicken lo mein are pretty good as well but I rarely order them because I love the other dishes more. I love that you can order noodles with your entrees in place of the rice but having the option of brown rice is nice as well when I am trying to watch what I eat. Another tip if you are watching calories: you can get any main dish with the chicken steamed instead of battered and fried. Pei Wei also makes the most amazing crab wontons with the best sauce evar!!! One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to crab wontons is when there is no crab. Hello, crab is in the name so it should be present in the dish! At Pei Wei, you can actually taste and see the crab in their wontons. Mix that with the sweet chili sauce they serve the wontons on and these are great! Don't get me wrong though, I've tried some of their other dishes that I was not a big fan of. Their thai coconut chicken was a little bland, the sweet and sour chicken is not what I look for in sweet and sour chicken (the sauce wasnt very strong), and the mongollian chicken had a strange flavor that I didnt care for. But to each his own, people have different taste. Anyways, Pei Wei is one of my favorite places to go and the prices are relatively cheap.

Where should I begin? We came in around 4PM to a restaurant that was not even half full and waited for a table for 15 minutes. When we got to our table we were left alone again for 10 minutes. We were pretty hungry at this point so we order a bit of food. The waitress gave us a stern look and told us it was too much in a more than your mother's naggy tone kind of voice. I assured her we can handle it. Classic rule of dining is that the customer is always right, even if they are wrong. I shrugged it off. 

This hasn't been out first time to a Korean AYCE style restaurant but after our interaction earlier, I guess our server took it upon herself to make up our minds on how we want to eat. We tried to keep it pleasant and light hearted but she kept on getting pushier and pushier as the afternoon went on. At the end of dinner we had paid and left her a decent tip (18%) underneath one of the cups. We made sure it was visible so it doesn't get accidentally get swept away during the table being turned over. We were in our car and about to go when the waitress ran out to our passenger door and knocked angrily on my car door. I lowered the window and asked her what was wrong. Our astute waitress, still huffing and puffing angrily, said we didn't even tip her. I calmly said we did and where it was. She then replied with an ""Oh..."" and then quickly ran back inside. We waited there 5 mins to see if she would come out and apologize as I thought we were entitled one for the way she was acting and for leaving prints on my car window. 

We will never return here. Never have I been so turned off at dinner by bad service. Had I known that that was the kind of service I would be getting I would have spent my money at an In and Out and got my money's worth and a smile to go with my chocolate shake.",7.0,2_v3cWaTjauIeQH2bOWa2A

Same great steaks and seafood (according to Hubby) and same great service.  We only had one iffy time while it has been Anthony's and our server corrected the problem immediately and professionally.  To preface this, we NEVER send back food but our steaks were clearly overdone; my filet was ordered medium but came out well done while Hubby's bone-in ribeye was ordered medium rare but, came out medium-medium well.  Again, I can't stress how well our server handled the situation.

When we go out for steaks, we're pretty much creatures of habit, filet mignon, ribeye, or bone-in ribeye.  Steaks at Anthony's are top-notch and can rival any steakhouse on the Strip.  Steaks do come with complimentary sauces such as bearnaise, bordelaise, and peppercorn--try the bordelaise!!!!  Another thoughtful note Anthony's provides for their steak diners are the complimentary roasted tomato topped with parmesan and a petite mixed greens salad with a very light lemon viniagrette.  For those of you who like french onion soup, please note they must've changed their recipe when they transitioned from Terzetto's to Anthony's.  The french onion soup tastes like it has tomato sauce/paste in it now; it used to be a robust beef stock flavor.  Sides are very good here.  I highly recommend their creamed corn.  Tater tots should be ordered only if you are having a very light dinner, as they're very dense and heavy.

Again, service is A to A+ and can also rival some of the most elite steakhouses on the Strip.

The contemporary decor in Anthony's hasn't changed much since it was Terzetto's.  It's still a very large restaurant with tons of seating options.  It has the oyster bar adjacent to it and a regular drinking bar off to the side.

They need white lettering or a fascia sign.  My only gripe is I feel the sandwiches are $1-$2 too expensive. If they were $8 I'd be more likely to be a regular. When you start talking $12 for an average sized sandwich and bag of chips it is borderline pricey.",1.0,fu-gH_BGfsEFu76rch9ydw

I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch with my boyfriend. We both really like the food when it's available almost every time I've been here they have been completely out of bagels( you call yourself a bagel shop).  I usually get the Tijuana Hot bagel sandwich on a jalapeño bagel which is really good. They make the food fresh right in front of you (except the bagels) I've had a few of their wraps too which were also good. So the food is great I think, I mean I've never had an issue with that, it is pricey for what you get a bagel sandwich ONLY will cost $7 no drink or side. If you get a meal you're looking at $13 and the portions are small, filling to a 5'1 105lb girl, my boyfriend usually has to get more food to feel full. BUT the environment is pretty gross, the tables are often dirty and sticky the place seems really unkempt, like they aren't really concerned about the appearance of the place at all floors are dirty and overall it just looks...well not super sanitary.

You know how you start writing the yelp review as soon as you enter the place? When I saw myself all thoughts left me except 'christ I look good.' 

It would be dismissive to give GwE 5 stars based only on their premise of Organic hair care and styling, but I might have done it anyway because I really truly believe that everyone needs to read the ingredient labels of all the products they use (hair, face, body) and really think about what dubious chemistry is seeping into their bodies every day. I will be a Green with Envy girl for the rest of my stay here in the Valley, not only because their business philosophy is ethical and whole-hearted but because they have excellent stylists. 

Today I saw Eric Flotta who was nice enough to take me as soon as he came in, even though I was half an hour early. And he didn't scream in horror at my post-workout hair, just led me over to the sink to start my wash/style/blowdry.  He told me about some of the organic products that the salon uses and carries for retail purchase and even mentioned that GwE uses the first and only hair color that doesn't include toxic chemicals. 

Eric didn't do any wild and crazy hair makeover on me, but my hair does look very sexy and different. I like that he could take my frightening mess and turn it into something simple and beautiful in not a lot of time and with minimal product in it.  He recommended a product to me and though I am a staunchly opposed to buying salon hair care I did because it's organic and makes me look nice! 

Also, they have a $35 women's haircut special which proves that earth-friendly organics can be luxurious AND affordable.  Now I want them to get some formaldehyde-free nail polishes and start up some manicures and pedicures!",10.0,rzq5nqG2NG13o3ISxJSrsQ

I went to four different office supply stores with no luck. I was just about to give up when Yelp led me to Midoco. They had plenty of the refill erasers, along with a smorgasbord of new writing utensil choices. Sadly, they don't have much by way of other Pentel pencils (boo), but they do have the Staedtler Fineliners that I love so much, in every color. They have other stuff, of course -- since Halloween is coming up, they have a bunch of wigs, makeup, and other goofy stuff. Also: Moleskines.

We went into the furniture outlet, thinking that we would see some of the same quality pieces that you find in the Ladlow's showroom, just at discounted prices for whatever the reason--a discontinued item, something someone returned, some kind of blemish, etc.

That was not the case.

Most of what you'll find in the outlet is stuff that you can find just about anywhere else, and even at discount furniture stores.  Bottom line, you have to do a lot of searching to find any great deals.  Just be wary of the quality of the items in the outlet store.  In fact, I recommend googling the reviews of the furniture manufacturers while in the store and certainly before purchasing.  

We were able to find a table that we liked and the discount was good, so we bought it.  It was delivered when scheduled.  The saleswoman was only slightly pushy but friendly.  She did try to tell us that certain leather furniture was high quality when, when researched, was really just mass-produced crap from China with many online reviews that complained about the quality and workmanship--or lack, thereof.

So after 12 years of loyalty it's time to move on.  Bought a Groupon and went on line to make an appointment when I forgot some information I decided to call. Tyler told me that the website is wrong and that they don't use it. I told him it said that to call if within a two hour period, he said he doesn't care what it says and they only take appointments until 3 and to call back after 3 to see if he could get me in.

I did and he said they were to busy to take any other cars.

Today, Thursday, I took off early to drive in to get into the midas, he sad it would be until 5 told him I would wait (2 hours).  I showed him the Groupon and he said they don't take them for synthetic oils, they only for conventional oils. I showed him the fine print.  I don't care what it says we don't take it, I can only give $15 credit. Told him unacceptable and walked out furiously.

Went home and called another midas and he said that he could do until he found out it was for the midas that wouldn't take the groupon. Told him what had happened.   He said they had to take it, he took my name and number.  Nick from midas tempe autoplex called back and said that they would take my car right away at this Midas and give me the up charge while using my groupon.

We ordered an appetizer, and 3 entrees spicy ""Hot"". Each is reviewed below:

Sampler $14.00 
Thai roll (2), Golden curry puff (2), Satay (2), & Kew Krob (6), served with plum sauce, peanut sauce & cucumber salad.

Everything was deep fried besides kabob/chicken. The chicken was cold and tasted like it had Feta cheese on it :(

Drunken Noodles* with Beef
Sautéed flat noodles with Napa cabbage, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, egg, Thai basil & chili pepper.

This was our favorite dish. Spicy and flavorful.

Gaeng Kua Sapparod**with Shrimp
""Red curry sauce, coconut milk, pineapple & kaffir lime leaves.

This did not taste right- like the kitchen ran out of sauce and they just added coconut milk to make it go further. The flavor was totally off. It was also not spicy at all.

Pad Thai with Chicken
Sautéed rice noodles with egg, sweet pickled radish, scallion, bean sprouts & ground peanuts.

The dish had no flavor. We had to ask for a lime to ad (usually comes with lime at other Thai restaurants) Very disappointed. Also NOT spicy like we ordered.

The service was slow and disappointing. The place was packed when we got there and I mean so packed it was hard to get to our table and hard for our severs to get around. We wanted to order dessert but nobody asked and we waited FOREVER to get our check.

I will say this don't order fried rice here they haven't mastered it yet and I think it's because they're not cooking it in a wok. It's very mushy and lacks flavor.

I've never seen a nail salon with such welcoming decor. It's usually the same office-like chairs and oversized, slightly uncomfortable massage chairs. The furniture here is contemporary but so comfortable and welcoming. I wanted to sink into those pedicure chairs but only had a manicure on my first visit. The salon is SPOTLESS. I was told that the pedicure tubs have their own disposable liners, which makes me feel so comfortable with how hygienic and clean this place is. 

Jenny did my manicure and she was fabulous. Very personable and so meticulous! I chose a pink glitter polish but expressed concerned that it wouldn't be dark enough with two coats. She initially tried and realized it wouldn't be, so she removed the polish and started over with a darker color for the first coat. I so appreciated how hard she worked to make my manicure perfect!  

My only complaints are that they are closed Mondays and Tuesdays (I've been meaning to come here for quite some time but, ironically, the only times I found myself available for pampering were on Mondays so I missed out for quite a few months... finally, when I was off on a Wednesday, I was able to make an appointment). I'd also like a separate drying area for my nails. I'm obsessive about making sure my nails are completely dry prior to leaving and I would literally sit for 40 minutes under the dryer if it meant they would be hardened and dry and I wouldn't ruin my lustrous new manicure!

 The scallop dish I had way better else where. It wasn't seared right, a very light sear.

Last I decided to go full out and order a full out dinner..

2 Tea Eggs, 1 Large Taro Sago, Deep Fried Milk, Durian Pancake, and a 1 specialty drink.. $26.50 take-out price..


The Tea Eggs were really just so-so.. and over priced at $1.25 each plus tax.. tasted legit and flavourful.. but only the first one.. second one was a fail.. ??

Deep Fried Condensed Milk was ok.. didn't taste bad.. it was missing sweetness.. it was fried pretty nicely and crispy on the outside.. and came with some sugar on the side.. but definitely needs to be sweeter on its own..

Durian Pancake was oh oh K K.... not enough real durian.. but for the price.. it was acceptable..

The Taro Sago is definitely worth a 4 star rating tho!! Super Taro flavour and perfectly chewy and al Dante Sago!!

I would imagine the other types of Sago would be great as well..",0.0,d3EqggaHzuON2t7k1Z30Fg

They purposely damaged my tire to spite me!!!

Yesterday morning, when I got an oil change, I was encouraged to upgrade to a higher quality oil - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my air filer - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my cabin air filer - I also declined.  It came to a point of forced upgrades where I literally said, ""I just want an oil change and I have to go.""

This morning I noticed my front tire was WAY low of air (they checked it yesterday).  I filled it asap but noticed air seeping uncontrollably through the valve.  I took to to a Goodyear (on Indian School) and they said, ""The only way this can happen is if someone loosens it.  There is no way it can come unloose by itself. The pressure is too high.""  They even asked if I, ""...had any enemies.""  When I told them, ""No, but I did get an oil change yesterday at the Jiffy Lube on 32nd they replied, ""This isn't the first time dude.  About once every few months someone comes in with this issue from that Jiffy Lube.""

Enough said.

I know corporate people at Shell Oil and jiffy Lube.  They are great people and they have supported my business.  I will always support Jiffy Lube but never (again) this franchise or their staff.

They have a preservative taste that once biting into, makes you think that these strawberry slices have been sitting in a plastic container somewhere for a couple of weeks.

My favourites: Kinoko (cheese and mushroom) bibimbap, Gindara (black miso cod), Ebimayo(fried shrimp doused in spicy mayo...drool), Takoyaki (octopus balls) & Okonomiyaki (japenese pancake).

The only item that fell a bit short was the seared tuna....the fish was a bit too cooked and the toppings a bit band.. but still edible.

But paired up with the name ""Cantina"" threw me off as it's actually an Americanized-Mexican resto within the Mandalay Bay Shoppes. 

PERKS
+ great service (attentive staff dressed in sports jerseys)
+ gigantic drinks - they have specialties such as the ""Bull Dog"" (margarita + beer), but I opted for a sangria
+ FISH TACOS ($14) two mahi mahi fish tacos were fried placed upon two corn tortillas with shredded lettuce, guacamole and pico de gallo. Very fresh and decent dish. (Note: apparently the most popular item on their menu)
+ CHIPS & SALSA & GUACAMOLE - salsas were fresh! Chips were crisp and the guac was devoured by everyone!

DIRTS
- prices: although the fish tacos were a decent meal, I thought the dish was WAY over-priced for Americanized-Mexican food (but alas, it's Vegas so they'll charge a bit more)
- noisy: my co-workers and I had a little get together here, although it was nice they were able to reserve a section for us. The whole resto is a bit noisy with the sports games going on and the chatter from all the customers
- not authentic
- mediocre drunk grub

FYI
*located in mini-strip mall walk-way in between Mandalay Bay & Luxor
*you can keep the gigantic glass of margarita once you've drank it all
*laundry list of margaritas are available 
*drinks range from $8-14
*many flat screen televisions to watch the latest sports game

So, I purchased the tickets from Groupon and thought my kids would enjoy a magic show.  It was my daughter's 9th birthday and she was really excited to see a magician.  

I have to agree that this was not the greatest show and quite disappointed on paying $100 for a family of 4.  You can see certain tricks being done, and personally, my husband, older daughter and myself were just bored.  I gave it 2 stars because my youngest enjoyed it a bit. It wasn't a mind blowing experience for her but rather, eh, it was ok.  

The room was extremely small and the way the chairs were positioned were not the greatest.  If you're not sitting in the front center or even on the front row of the site aisle (where GA admission would sit), it's not a great view.

We could've done without them. Let me tell you, I need to find a recipe or recipe dupe for the honey butter they serve with their bread - it is to DIE for. I wanted to try their pasta but opted for a steak since most reviews said they have the best steaks in the province. We ordered the Chipotle Sirloin and it was really good ... a TAD bit too much oil on my plate but it was very tasty and cooked to perfection.

We ordered a pitcher of their sangria and it was really good - you could actually taste the alcohol which for me is a plus because there is nothing I hate more than a watered down alcoholic beverage. For dessert we shared their chocolate brownie and it was really good except when they brought it, the ice cream was almost all gone and melted all over the plate.

The service is impeccable, the oysters are fresh, and the food is really good. However, I cannot give it that 5th star because nothing about the restaurant's food stands out per se (no pun intended Mr. Keller).

I've been to Bouchon twice and both times I sat at the bar. I also happened to get the same bartender and this guy is so on top of his game that you would think he has been doing this his whole life. He is a courteous chap with a pleasant demeanor and offers good recommendations all around.

The first time I went, I had the french onion soup, the moules frites, and the pot de creme. Each dish was delicious and the french onion soup was especially good. The second time, I had a half dozen oysters (really, really good), duck confit, and pork belly. 

The confit was a bit disappointing though it was cooked as well as any confit I have ever seen yet it was still a tad dry on the inside and a bit flavorless. I wasn't a big fan of the pool of nectarine juice it was swimming in either and that did not make up for the dryness.

I highly recommend the Moules Frites. It is simply a bowl of mussels with a very flavorful white-wine/saffron sauce and a batch of really good french fries.

The lemon tart was not so great. It was too tart and the texture wasn't anything special. This is something that I know folks can make better at home.

Overall the experience was great. I love Thomas Keller and his creations. I love the service and atmosphere of the restaurant itself. It isn't overly crowded and sitting at the bar is always fun when you have a good bartender. However, I cannot offer that fifth star to Bouchon because I'm sure it's food can be so much more (and this is a restaurant review no?). Maybe next time...",0.0,xXw7C9RV_eVGSllVAajsRA

It's hard to miss the restaurant from the street with the beautiful purple trees outside (also found inside).  We barged right in, shoved two long tables together and waited for all (8) family members to arrive.  The dining space is huge! It almost seemed like after all the dining patrons have gone home the staff could easy shove all the tables aside and turn it in to one huge after hours dance party. A better analogy would be to describe the inside of The Village as a cafeteria, is that better?

On to the menu. A one-sided card with menu items listed there didn't appear to be anything over $10.00 on the entire menu; now you're speaking my language!  The hummus was eh, the pita bread was decent, and chicken kabob was ok.  Each entree comes equipped with it's own little mini ""salad"" -- I have placed salad in parenthesis because it was literally 4 pieces of lettuce, 2 cucumbers, and 2 slices of tomato; obviously not the highlight of the meal.  The chicken kabobs were decent, healthy portion of rice served with this dish (never a bad thing in my book), but you have to order the yogurt sauce as a separate side; I didn't therefore my chicken lacked a tad in flavor.

All in all there's not much to report regarding the service since it's pretty much a ""fast food"" type Mediterranean eatery where you seat yourself, order, pick up your food and grab your own drinks from the drink station.  

It's a cute concept but for me, not being in my neck of the woods and all I doubt I will find myself driving 25 minutes specifically to eat at The Village.

As someone that is half Brazilian, and has been to several Brazilian steak houses, this was a very similar experience with people walking around with the meat on the poles.

We had a variety of meats and the Bolo de Brigaderio for dessert. I love brigaderios, and this was really delicious 

My only problem was that they didn't have the famous Brazilian soda, Guarana, which is something that I always look forward to drinking when I visit Brazilian restaurants.

I do have one tip to customers. I made an online order with the steak meat on the side. NEVER ORDER THE MEAT ON THE SIDE.

I'm pregnant so I can't have raw meat, but I love chipotle. I didn't want to be a pain so I figured I'd just order it on the side and cook it to well done at home.

I only got a TINY little plastic tub of meat...I asked the lady at the register,""this is the meat on the side??"" She almost looked ashamed and said,""uhh, yea..""

*there's a photo reference.

Needless to say, I'm sure once I can eat undercooked meat again I'm sure I'll be back. Just sorta sucked because you pay so much for their food, you'd think they'd have larger containers nearby. Plus I know this is a special request.

my first and second visits was unbelievable. we ordered all his signature dishes: sweet potato hash, roasted shrimp tamale, queso fundido, tuna tartare, chilequiles, and those wonderful margaritas. every single one of those dishes were well thought out and quite tasty. i understood why bobby flay is who he is and why his food made him so famous. 

then my last three visits. the hash was over doused in green chile holladaise, the mesa burger was overcooked (even medium would've been ok, but please don't give me medium well), and the lamb salad had no flavor. i was wondering to myself ""what happened?""

i think that bobby flay has been to the restaurant less, so food quality control is probably not where it should be. hopefully, the restaurant sees that they're going down (they just lost their michelin star this year) and tries to pick it back up.

It was easy to get a consultation appointment and the front desk staff is always cheerful and helpful. The location was easy to find with ample parking. My consultation was great and the insurance coordinator worked with my father to ensure that my procedure would be correctly filed with a new insurance policy. Even during a typically busy week (college spring break) I was able to schedule my surgery quite easily within my stringent schedule.  I was given four prescriptions - nausea pill, two types of pain management (one for morning of surgery) and an antibiotic. 

The morning of the surgery I was welcomed by Dr. Bond's warm candor and put under general anesthesia which made the procedure go by instantly. I woke up and had hardly any bleeding, no pain, and I wasn't drugged up "" a la"" the infamous youtube videos you see these days. The staff explained the next steps to my father and off I went to recover. 

Recovery was simple and I had absolutely no side-effects. No nausea, no chipmunk cheeks, no swelling or bruising. It was honestly as close to a perfect recovery as possible and I attribute that to Dr. Bond's talent and finesse with his craft.

Everything about this show was what the old Vegas was all about ... comedy, elegance, fantastic dancing and terrific LIVE music. In fact, I can easily say that the band made all the difference in the world. They are surprisingly high above the stage in the back and become an integral part of the show. Lora Kelsey and Sophia Monica are extremely sexy, talented and make you ""drool"" zombie style for more. Patrick Leahy is also a riot in his performance and you can tell he's an audience favorite. I don't think Augustus Scott was Zenoch this night but it was alright because the stand-in was brilliant. There was more ""gayness"" references than I need to listen to but these are entertainers and this is Las Vegas. It is well worth and more the box office price to see this production.

I do NOT recommend getting the show/dinner package. The restaurant they pair you with called Pampas Brazilian Grille are a bunch of jerks. They have two lines they put you in... one for show vouchers and one for walk-in customers. They told us 25 minutes (two hours before the show) that they would seat us. They said they would page us. While I am sitting there they are seating each and every walk-in customer. They never paged us at all.

I came as part of the UYE hosted by Jen S. and dined with Steve W., Anthony M., Misti Y., Bobby Y. and my other half Eric R.  We shared two yagyu specials for the table (skirt steak, ribeye, and short rib) plus an order of tongue.  Eric R. also got shrimp and a salmon avocado roll, Steve got kimchi, and we all split a wakame soup from the suggestions of Misti and Bobby.

The soup was pretty amazing, so I would go back for that in a minute!  The broth was flavorful, and it had long strands of egg (my kind of egg drop yo!), wakame and green onions.  They gave us 5 small bowls and we were all able to share it (and one order is only $4.50).  

Surprisingly, the ribeye was least fatty of the meats but my favorite nonetheless.  The only dipping sauce I really liked of the 4 was the sesame oil that was seasoned with some salt.  Eric R. and I also got our own bowls of rice which was a great addition to our meal.  The meats overall tasted great, and I especially liked the marbled tongue.  It was a real treat that I am glad we tried!

Jen S. and I also grilled up the kabocha garnishes from the meat plate and that was actually a really great idea!  I did not get a chance to try the kimchi but Steve and Anthony seemed to like it.  I had one shrimp (hard to mess that up!) and one taste of Eric's sushi - this isn't the place for sushi but it was perfectly fine.

When I return, it is wakame soup, tongue and ribeye for me plus the ice cold beer.  The guys ordered pork cheek with miso at the end but I do not partake in the pig :)  It was a fun interactive meal and I am glad I met Steve, another educator.  I also owe many thanks to the generous Jen S. for hosting and sharing his groupon.",2.0,T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA

So it's basically a hot plate with pork slices, bean sprouts, and other small flavourings. The side dishes are the typical ones you get at your average korean restaurants. In addition, this place gave us a seaweed soup, which was nice and bland that balanced the heavier taste from the pork. Also, there was a nice lettuce salad that helped balance everything too.

Our waiter cooked everything for us so all we needed to do was to eat. After we were done about about 60% of the dish, my friend ordered rice and the waiter added the rice into the remaining contents of the hot plate and made it into a korean fried rice dish. 

Overall, this may not be the most healthy meal, but it was definitely filling (mmm carbs...). It is also pretty good and cost friendly.

We went on Memorial Day, a Monday, at around 9:30 a.m.  It wasn't very busy yet, so we were seated right away (by our server, in fact; I guess there was no host on duty yet).  There were tables scattered here and there with people, but nothing significant.  

Our server was great.  He was very friendly and attentive...at least until it was time for the check and he was overwhelmed with the now-crowd of diners.  It looks like the kitchen and management are where the problems lie.  For breakfast, it took wayyyyyy too long for us to get our food (between 30-45 minutes), especially when the restaurant was not yet crowded.  We never once saw a manager; nobody when we walked in or out or walking the dining room to apologize for/correct the food delays.  And, sadly, the food was just average.  Gone are the days when a Mimi's breakfast stood out from the crowd.  My ham and cheese omelet was nothing special and looked sloppily assembled.  We could/should have just gone to IHOP for better, quicker food.  

On a related note, it seems the Mimi's Cafes I used to go to in Orlando have closed due to poor service and a decline in food quality.  It looks like Charlotte's is not far behind.  We won't be back.

I saw this one, with the 4.5 stars and that it was right across the street from our hotel (Marriott) and thought it was a good choice. 

As others have stated, there is only one entree.  Your only choice is whether  you want soup or not and we ordered it.  We also ordered some house wine and were served bread and butter with it.  The bread was good and so was the wine - what I'd expect for the price.
 
The carrot soup was ok.  It was a bit bland but not bad;  That was the highlight of the meal!  The 'salad' was iceberg lettuce, walnuts (right out of the bag) and a bland vinaigrette dressing that was very acidic.  They could have at least toasted the walnuts if not glaze them and it wouldn't take much effort to improve the looks and flavor of the salad by adding a bit of arugula or other mix.

  The main course, was of coarse, the steak and fries.  The steak was very low grade, tough and not a lot of flavor.  The sauce helped a bit.  The fries were fine for what they were.

The price is $26.95 per plate which is way too much for the quality of the food served.

Service was ok, not bad but nothing special either.

The two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. Upper Crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which I am not crazy about. The wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey BBQ sauce. The meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but Stephanie H would disagree. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 7pm and on Wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine.

The food was excellent and everything was prepared wonderfully.  From the Steakhouse Salad, Crab Cakes, T-Bone for 2 and sides...all delicious.  The drinks were equally awesome.

My rant, however, would be the service.  We came here a month ago and sat in the main dining room.  Again, food was awesome but service so-so.  They forgot my birthday dessert but we were full anyways so it wasn't a big deal, just disappointing.

This time, we sat in the bar area to hear the live music.  Atmosphere not as romantic as it was crowded and noisy...but it was to be expected.  No biggie.

Our waitress was nice and helpful when around, but most of the time...WHERE DID SHE GO?

She was too busy helping the party near us with cocktails.  We were the least of her worries, or at least it felt that way.  Everything was sloooow.  Spacing between appetizers, main course and dessert was T O O FAR A P A R T!

Oh well, not a big deal! I check my receipt to triple check I paid for it - there it is! 1 x avocado $0.99! I go up to the front thinking it would be no big deal. I tell the sweet waitress, Erica, that I didn't get any avocado and ask if I can have some in a condiment cup. She says yes, asks the guy that's closest to her in the kitchen. He accuses me of lying, berates Erica and tells her he knows he put it on my burger. This dude must have issues - why the heck is he making a scene, saying I'm lying and being rude to his coworker? I am so caught off guard by this. I look at Erica and tell her I'll show her my burger and my receipt. I do. She apologize and grabs me my dang avocado.

I flew all the way from Seattle to Vegas to celebrate my 40th bday. Thinking, this place will be a good place for me, my sisters, brother in laws n husband a place to enjoy n celebrate my bday. Well, let me tell u.. we were so disappointed n wrong. I couldn't believe how poor ur management n security handle situation when u had too much to drink. Yes, I admitted had drunk too much that I did actually vomited inside ladies restroom.  
Not to the point, that I made a mess on the floor or did not make it to toilet. I managed to walked n did my business inside ladies room. I managed to clean n flush the toilet to make sure it was spottless. 

As soon as I went back to r booth.. one of the security guard was talking to my brother in law n want us to leave because according to him.. I was too drunk to be there. At that time, I was just sitting n drinking my water observing n thinking.. what the hell is going on. We left r booth n waited for r parties on the waiting area to take care of r bill. Again, this security guard told us that we can't be there n have to leave the premises. That time, was already getting pissed off n heated up by the way they treated us. We got to this place @9pm n listened to the live band(sounded good by the way) enjoyed listening to them.

We took advantage of they'r 2hrs unlimited drink for price of$47 Ithink.  We ordered drinks n enjoyed drinking. That's the reason why we were there for, right. Well, if u guys r offering unlimited drinks in ur lounge expect that u will have drunk people. I had fly me to the moon, mai tai n rum n coke. Hmm, 3drinks within 2hrs was not WORTH IT!! that 3drinks for me was enough that I had too much already n had already gone to restrm. Well, after 2hrs they told us we can't stay in r booth  n we need to moved. But if we want to stay, we have to order drink to keep the booth.  Orderd a bottle of bombay n juice just to keep r booth. They suck u up to order so u can keep ur booth. Again, why did u guys kicked us out coz I had too much to drink n can't handle myself(according to them) but yet, u offered us to ord more drinks to keep r booth. 
Not only we got kicked out @12:30 at night(still too early didn't even got a chance to dance on the dance floor). 

I found out next day r bill was $800.00. What  the f***, how much again for party of 8. Come to find out they did 2 separate bill. First, 2hrs bill unlmted drinks so about $400 plus r food chips dips maybe $500 + gratuity of course there were 8 of us 15 or 20% of r total bill. Had another bill they chg after 2hrs+gratuity again of course. Oh, wait there is more another charge for the booth we reserved but did not tell us we have to move after 2hrstotally shocked at this lounge.. billed us twice gratuity that's 40% no wonder r billed was $800. We didn't even finished r drinks that was ordered after that 2hrs unlimited coz u kicked us out. 

Now, u guys tell me if I was out of control that night.. as far as I know.. didn't say anything nor made a scene to get kicked out. The only time that I started dropping the f** word when I found out that we were getting kicked out coz of me. My only mistake was.. I had too much to drink n I threw up in the ladies room using the toilet bowl n did not made a mess. If I had too much too drink..then why the Hell do I remember all this.!! that's because,  I was not toxicated at all!! I think ur mgmt n security guard did so poorly judging me that I was belligerent n not able to contempt myself just because I threw up in the ladies rm. 

Thx, blue martini for ruining my 40th bdy n made me think that ur night club will be an epic place to be. I was looking forward to celebrate n enjoyed myspecial day that night with my family but instead worst time of my life. A night that I will never forget..disappointed place to celebrate ur special day. Ur security guard looked at me like I was being belligerent n can't handle myself. Again, u can't judge a person just the way they look n act. 

Understand, protocol n security of others is ur priority. But also need to realize ur lounge serving alcohol will not expect that customers will not get drunk. I felt humiliated getting escorted by ur security which until now.. still trying to find out WHAT I DID WRONG THAT NIGHT.
Ur security need much training when to act or escort people out on how much they've drink. He judge me so poorly that I was not able to handle myself. I did not trash ur place, bother anyone nor I vomited in front of everyone. 

Not my recommendation to celebrate special day coz they judge u on how u look if u had too much to drink. My 1st time getting kicked out on my 40th bdy n in Vegas..

I went on new years eve for an early dinner with an old friend. It was busy but they still found a table for myself and a friend. We ordered the usual (6 of everything). I still wish there was more rice in an order, since everything you order is a stack of meat. they dont give you alot of starch or carbs to process the meat. however, the meat was great and i still love the concept of cookin my own food at my table (even if they are small slices of meat that even the most illiterate foodie could cook). 

one thing i wish that ALL the korean grill houses had was BIGGER WATER GLASSES. Now that I'm thinking about it its actually very frustrating. If you're going to chop meat into small slices and cure them with salt to keep them fresh (anybody with half a brain knows that when u cut a piece of meat into thin slices like korean grill house does, it dries out quicker and adding salt to it makes it last longer so you can sell it to the masses before it expires) you can at least let us have large water glasses to stay hydrated instead of making the poor kids working the floor fill up our water glasses every 30 seconds.

When we got to there, the environment got us on the first, cozy and great staff, all owners of this little boutique restaurant, they explain every detail you ask, it shows they care for their reputation and experience for the customer. You feel the Brazilian culture, but something more is there...

The food is a fusion of brazilian traditional food, some other latin favorites, all with a special touch. We tried the beef chick poutine, with fried casaba. After we went for the lomito sandwich, that was unexpected, and delicious, imagine pork, with guava bbq, avocado sauce, on a potato bread, and on the side plantain chips! You might think where are the traditional Brazilian choices? They have feijoada, cheese bread, pasteis and others, but we're glad we went on the other side of the menu.

Options of beer and wines, i went for the beers, which are no traditional brands, but good drafts.

The downside would will be a bit pricy for the portions, but add the flavour and ambient, and the place is totally worthy. Opinion of a Brazilian that enjoys food with unique taste!",3.0,kz-Bv_ZTRIOMuw_iwksqLQ

On the plus side, you are close to the action, and that's part of the allure of going to Spring Training games. You can get draft beer for either $4 or $8, peanuts for $4, and water for $4. (Though the latter two can be had outside the park for even less.)  

Yes, there is parking onsite for some of the patrons, others must park in overflow lots blocks away and hoof it in. Though, that's probably a better alternative than the absolute clusterf*ck getting out after the game from the onsite lots. 

Seating is about half stadium seats with backs and armrests; and about half the seats are cheap, metal-bench bleacher seats (and about as comfortable as sitting on a rock for three hours). Not to mention that virtually all of the seats are in the blazing hot sun until later in the game (but there's really only shade for those seats behind home plate). And when it's in the 90s, and there's no wind, it can get pretty brutal sitting in the seats - which would actually more suitable for frying eggs on.

Fortunately, the concourse from third base to right field is shaded, but there's not enough room for all the scores of people wanting to stand in the shade behind the green line. So if you want to stand in the concourse on a hot day, you'll get to play the part of a sardine (packed with all the other sardines) to a tee. 

Somewhat strangely, one of two novelty stores is outside the park (see pic) with portable toilets. They stamp your hand to get back into the park if you use the toilets or visit the store. 

Overall, it is Spring Training, and it's hard to screw that up, but what the Angels really need to do to upgrade this place is eighty-six those rock-hard bleacher bench seats and widen those concourses like a normal baseball park with some elbow room.

""A lil tequila lime chicken please,"" I said. Their idea of ""lil"" is not the same as mine, but do not mistake this as a complaint. Generous portions of all your typical fixings (lettuce, pico, guac, cheese, peppers) plus unique ones such as noodles (A MUST!) and ""crunchies"" (AKA those hot-as-death chips) are piled sky-high to the point one must wonder, how will these wonderfully nice people close this burrito?

It's a true art what they do here, managing to fit all those toppings into one tortilla is a skill most enviable. The tequila lime is my favourite, but my partner in crime swears by the baja chicken. I've also tried the baked yam (though don't be fooled: to heat it up they do toss it in the deep fryer for a minute) and it was awesome, again huge portions. The pulled pork is my friend's fave, but it wasn't for me. They have a large selection of flavours, as well as quesadillas that are built much the same. 

Be warned: the hot sauce here is super hot! The last time I got a burrito here I passed on all things spicy.

This location moves a LOT of merchandise and rotates their inventory continuously, so it goes without saying that if you see something you think you might enjoy owning and don't grab it immediately, you may not get a second chance. 

There's very little risk of buyer's remorse thanks to Costco's very liberal return policy. I don't relish chances to return things, but the handful of times I've been legitimately unsatisfied with the quality of a product, they have taken it back, no questions asked. 

Lastly, Costco has absolutely, hands-down, the best crab legs you will ever have the chance to buy.

Besides the pianist, our bartender Harry was cool. He was straight to the point while offering some laughs. He also refilled a friends drink after it was knocked over which was cool.

Be prepared to complete destroy normal running or walking shoes on the sand stone and sharp rocks on the way.  There is no clear path up but if you follow the trail signs, then stick to the left of the gully on the way up you should see many footpaths.  You want to aim yourself to be about 100 feet to the left of the flat rock face/wall of Turtlehead, then wrap around the back and up.  

Kids who are used to hiking and listen to their guardians (about not going near the edge) will enjoy the hike.  We've had 8-10 year olds out a few times and I've seen dogs a couple times.  I would not recommend dogs without protective booties though on their feet.  They'd get torn up :(

Be careful of the cactus and sharp bushes -- bring gloves just in case you take a slight tumble.  I've seen many people pulling 2 inch thorns out of their hands here.  Watch your step, drink plenty of water and enjoy the view.

Red Rock has roughly 12 other peaks in the park on the scenic loop which are not marked trails by the park though they are well established by the hiking community.  Check out Juniper Peak, Rainbow Peak, Bridge Mountain, or if you are feeling adventurous White Pinnacle Peak.  Juniper is my favorite for a good 3-4 hour hike!",4.0,I1CaDvV3J5YymlQ8jAYCwg

Last week I asked if they could change my oil. The man said to drop the car off on Thursday night and leave the key in the key drop, he would get the job done on Friday. I left the car in the lot, dropped the key in the slot, and came back for it on Friday afternoon even though I had no phone call telling me it was ready for pickup.

To my surprise, the shop was closed during Friday business hours when I arrived! Nobody was around, the car had not been touched, my key was still inside the shop, and the phone number was going to voicemail. I left without my car.

I called again on Saturday. Voicemail again. No car. Called again on Sunday. Voicemail again. No car. Finally someone answered on Monday. I told him I would be there to pick up my car in the afternoon and was told they would be closing early, and would be closed by the time I got there. Unbelievable.

I managed to arrange to get my car back finally after FOUR DAYS. Luckily I was able to make do without it by bothering my friends and borrowing their cars when I needed to go somewhere, and had no emergencies, but imagine if I actually needed to use my own vehicle! Unprofessional and unacceptable. I would not recommend using this garage unless you are comfortable with not getting your car back for days with no communication because they decided not to work that day for some unknown reason.

- Locally roasted coffee beans:

- Baristas with proper training on pulling espresso

Their meat cannot be compared and they are so organized.   It was scary when I arrived to a line up at 930am when they opened.  But they were quick and had my order ready for me and ready to go.

However, if I had NOT made this before I would have been in big trouble because they gave me the wrong kind of bacon and its really such a key ingredient in this recipe.

I went to them specifically knowing that they are the best.  I asked for the top of the line meat for this recipe cut into 2 inch cubes along with a chunk of top bacon cut into 1/4inch by 1 1/2 inch lardons.  This task of cutting and cubing would save me a great deal of time.

Well they gave me strips of bacon cut into 1/4 inch pieces.  And they gave me meat cut into 4"" squares....Thankfully their policy is to show you what you ordered before you finish the purchase.  Had I not know what lardons were I would have taken the mush of bacon they had put in a vacuum sealed bag.  

thankfully they quickly fixed the order and all was good and Beef was the best I have ever made.  So just remember they may have good meat but know what you ordered dont expect them to always be brilliant.....",4.0,jyVHqwYc-ijO-eh1hkrZ5Q

I liked their frame selection because they carry Gucci, Dior, & Oliver People's but they are TERRIBLE at doing lenses. If you have bad eyesight and actually need glasses to do their job, do not come here. 

My husband and I both got the poly-carbonate lenses with anti-glare and I was so disappointed by the quality. I needed my glasses adjusted when I got them (as everybody does) and the crappy lab that these people send their glasses to put on a cheap layer of anti-glare so that when they're adjusted, they literally melt and smear!!! Who does that!? I've been wearing glasses for 10 years now and have never had to deal with something so ridiculous. 

After my first fitting and my lenses got smeared, they sent them back and received the second pair a week and a half later. Those got smeared during the adjustment process too. Those were sent back and on my 3rd pair, the people realized that they'll have to put a cloth over the lenses to not get them too hot so they won't smear. What a hassel! This place is so far from my house and every time I need adjustments, I have to come back here in hopes that my lenses won't smudge and I'll be screwed out of glasses. I've had those glasses since last February and about 6 months in, the anti-glare began rubbing off at the bottom and continued to do so until my frames snapped two nights ago. 

My husband's anti-glare actually got smudged because he left his glasses out in the car one day and then tried to clean them. This place offers a one year warranty on their lenses so they replaced them for free, but it was still an incredible inconvenience. I will never recommend anybody nor return here again. My father-in-law also purchased a pair of glasses here and had the same problem of the anti-glare wearing after a couple of months. So cheap. Go across the street to Lenscrafters where you pay a little more but you only have to wait one hour instead of 1 month to get a pair of working glasses.",10.0,EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw

Pizza Nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one I've ever frequented.  The pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  Not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.  You dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put.  The lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings.  It's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza.  We didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was.  If there was a better option in the area I wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't.",1.0,EooPlnjGDXVbrWAb4Uh4RQ

Angus Glen Public Library is nice and roomy, with plenty of windows, skylights and high ceilings.

There are plenty of seatings (sofas and seats) so you can just lounge around or you can use the private rooms if you want to have some privacy.

There are good selections of current paperbacks and best sellers. Most of them are in great conditions and some of them brand news since the library is only 3 years old or so.

The waiter said the owner takes particular care in ensuring the oysters are fresh shipping them in temperature controlled containers. 

Daughter got the crispy calamari and contrary to what I thought, the calamari is tender and served hot.  No hard chewy calamari here. The sauce is refreshing also, light and lemony.  I ate too much.

Moving on to the salad. The ceasar is served with a Parmesan cracker. Good but nothing to write home about. Wife had the wedge salad, she said the dressing was a tad too watery.

Main dish was a bit disappointing. My daughter had the clams and pasta dish. Clams were really salty...voodoo clams. The pasta was better. I had the Spaghetti and Halibut. That dish was rather plain.  The wife had lobster ravioli. She enjoyed it so that was the best dish of the three. Gnocchi side was good, slightly mushy but tasty.

The place is clean & comfortable, with a nice ambiance and we've always had good service (even on crazy fight nights when the placed is packed).  We have found the prices to be a little high for a sports bar style menu, but when you consider they don't charge a cover fee for UFC events & sometimes have coupons, it's not too bad.

The food isn't 5 star amazing, but it's pretty solid for a joint like this.  We've tried probably about half the stuff on the menu in the years we've been visiting Augie's.  For the appetizers, the egg-roll-wrapped mozz sticks & pretzel sticks are the best of the bunch.  Their wings are run-of-the-mill & sadly they don't offer variable heat levels on the buffalo style (it's a soft medium IMO).  The burgers & sandwiches are mostly good, but not exceptional.  The best things on the menu are the ribs & pizza.  The ribs are baked/grilled style rather than smoked, but they're super tender with a sweet sauce & fall off the bone.  The pizza is probably our favorite thing at Augie's.  If fact, I'd even say I was kinda shocked at how good it was when we first tried it.  The crust is a bit bready, but it really works with the sauce & cheese they use.  It's definitely worth a try.  Pro tip - order it ""well done"" to get a nice slightly charred edge.  For dessert, the chocolate brownie sundae thing is surprisingly awesome.  It's simple, but good & surely plentiful.

All in all, we're lucky to have a joint like this out in the far west valley.  They have friendly service, show UFC fights for free, and the food is above-average for this kind of place.",1.0,v9x8w8sydxObZ2Z_Y7lIHg

A minute after our reservation time, we walked back to the hostess and she asked us ""How can I help you?"" It seemed like she had already forgotten our faces in such a short time?

We were taken to our table on the second floor where a waitress was setting our table. She introduced herself as our waitress, and we sat down.

FOOD: The food was great. The oysters were wonderful. We all wanted to try the French onion soup, which they split into half portions for us (unexpected and nice of them to do). The bone in ribeye was perfectly cooked and very good, but the real star was the 10 oz filet. Honestly, I wish I had been the one to order it, because it was one of the best cuts I have ever had. The truffle mashed potatoes were a great addition as a side. 

Overall, the quality of the meat was excellent. I did feel like the steak could have been seasoned more. Other than that, no complaints here. 

SERVICE: Here is where things went a bit downhill. Lets start with the positives - first, the hostess was very nice and sat us at a great spot near the windows to watch the fountains. We were also visited by [who I am assuming is] the manager of the restaurant, who was very quick to respond to any requests we had. These two individuals were not only helpful, but very friendly and personable. 

The negatives - from the very moment we sat down, I got the feeling we were being rushed by our server. There is a difference between being attentive and being overly pushy. Our table felt that we were experiencing the latter. Additionally, we all felt that both servers for our table were relatively unfriendly and standoffish.

I was also unimpressed by the attitude of the individual who split the check. Two of us were in Vegas on business and needed to split the check so that certain dishes were included on different cards. For some reason, this was met with frustration. In fact, the server responsible for the check walked away from me mid-sentence as I was explaining how it needed to be split up. Not a great touch. 

OVERALL: The food and the atmosphere were very good. However, they weren't good enough to make up for the lack of personable/helpful service that you should get if you're paying to eat at an upscale restaurant like Prime claims to be. 

Our family visits Vegas frequently but it's unlikely we will be back due to the service (and the fact that there are so many other great alternatives in the area). I would also hesitate to recommend this for business outings - no need to deal with attitude from the server over splitting the check when there are so many other restaurants who are more than willing to accommodate this type of request.",0.0,zcX5fJO2dmOkYOJiWw5SkQ

The first time I dropped in was for a take-away Nespresso/ espresso coffee, which was quite good.  The second time I came by for a take-away salad, which was ok.  To my taste, most of the salads feature poorly combined ingredients, as if disregarding taste, someone randomly selected trendy ingredients like caramelized pecans to throw in with what-have-you.

I considered exploring other things on the menu during their half-price evening specials, but discovered that it was only dine-in.  The ambiance doesn't really appeal to me, especially if it gets busy, so I didn't bother.

Then, a breakfast special sign appeared in the window:  bottomless coffee, eggs, toast for $5.99.  No bacon or sausage.  Not the best of deals, but still convenient and good.  And mornings were not too crowded, before the high school students descend.  I found the breakfast to be a good start to the day, and the endless coffee was good and strong and dark-roast.  Even the music was ok.  For the price, I was willing to disregard the atmosphere with the big-screen tv and the smell of Pine-Sol permeating the place and interfering with my tastebuds.

Regular breakfasts are just ok. I tried an omelette once which was overcooked.  I had the Huevos Rancheros another time and quite enjoyed that.  I don't quite know how it is possible, but much of the food doesn't have flavour.

And then, they installed the sliding windows-- which is great-- but they removed the tables at the front windows and replaced them with sofa chairs and wee drink tables: I don't get it.  The breakfast special is gone.  The coffee has now become medium roast acidic diner stuff. The music is now AM radio.  I asked for extra salsa with my meal and was charged for it.
I won't be back.  The things that I was enjoying have disappeared, and the sum of what is left is not worth the experience to me.  The place seems uncertain as to what it wants to be and to whom.",0.0,ckrG0CFMRrKQL8P8kicGqw

My wife and son took our Edge in for a routine oil change and next thing I know they are given a recommendation that ranged in the thousands of dollars. The service advisor made it sound like it was urgent and we would be taking a risk if the work was not done. I took my car to a trusted mechanic and he said none of the recommended work needed to be done right away and some not for a long time. After hearing this, I felt like the service person was just trying to make money through scare tactics. I have bought 3 cars from this facility and have done service through them since then but now I will not bring my cars back again and I will not buy another car from them because I don't trust their ethics any longer! I understand the need to let the customers know what could potentially be wrong but they should also be honest and add when they really need to be fixed to give the full picture.

There must have been an entire handful of chives in the tacos. I ended up having to spend five minutes picking enough out so I could actually taste the meat.

The negative reviews on this place's wait times and busyness should not count against it. This restaurant just opened no more than 5 months ago, it is located on the busy P83 strip with tons of people and near the Arrowhead Mall, and is only a moderate sized restaurant. 
     When my husband and I first arrived we heard the wait was almost 2 hours but for a party of 5+ - for just me and my husband we were sat right away. Large families/parties need to realize that places that have just opened up are going to be super busy and have long wait times - its common sense. We sat at a small side table and were not too shocked at how busy and compacted everyone was. We expected it and were happy to see all the buzz around the place. Our waiter got our drinks immediately and walked us through the menu. He warned us about a large party that had just arrived and that we needed to put any pizza order in soon other wise it would be over an hour wait for a Chicago style pizza. 
     My husband and I wanted to go a different route and ordered a pasta and sandwich instead. The wait time on the pizza was not a negative strike to us - we knew hand making a pizza from scratch takes time and we were more interested in the other dishes anyways. My husband ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich and I ordered the Marinara Spaghetti while we shared the Giordano's Sampler. The food was FANTASTIC and i'll be posting pictures of it too. It was rich and flavorful with a real taste of care and love. The only negative part of the meal was that everything came out all together and quite quickly. I believe my husband and I waited just over 10 minutes to get our appetizers, salads, and entrees. Our table almost couldn't fit it all. I ended up having to not finish my salad because I did not want my entree to get cold. 
     Other than that my husband and I had a great meal and really enjoyed the atmosphere. We also appreciated our waiter and his thoughts in items on the menu that were best for us and our time frame. I will definitely be back to have more from this delicious establishment - but with a party no larger than 3 I think for the next few months.",0.0,BpKfQng1IAcwKjnj1nSHrg

The fitness center was well-equipped and clean, and I was glad that complimentary earphones are provided for watching TV on the machines since I hadn't thought to bring mine. The pull-out sofa beds are also a huge plus if you are there with a group. I used their tea kettle (Le Creuset!) to heat up water in the morning and the fridge kept our leftovers fresh.

Little things here and there weren't perfect - no robes in the room, no newspaper on the first morning, and lights in closets didn't work - but they were all extremely minor things that I didn't care about enough to call.

2. Spicy crispy eggplant: amazing flavor!!! Another popular choice. Taste and looks exactly like fries but healthier and tastier. Bit sweet and spicy and crunchy! Definitely eat it in the restaurant because it will get soggy if you take away.

3. Veggie pan fried noodles: AMAZING. Very hot (temperature), crispy, excellent gravy, and tons of veggies and sit shrimps. Another must try! 

4. Curry tamarind fish with veggies: Nice curry taste but too sour for our liking. We ended up changing the order to regular curry and it was much better. The fish is soy and wrapped in seaweed for the ""fish"" taste. Not bad but not my favorite because of the tofu texture which throws off my taste buds.

Came for dinner and at the sushi bar. I was served pretty quickly. Perhaps not the most friendliest of staff but they were great at getting food to me efficiently. With the slightly pricier dinner, you get single orders of a couple of exclusive items like sashimi salad and uni nigiri for example. They were of of the latter the night I went but I still had my fill on a variety of fresh nigiri. I thought the ratio of fish to rice was surprisingly decent. Also tried their highly recommended ""The Shit"" appetizer and it was alright but fans of deep fried items dipped in sweet creamy sauces might like this a lot. Loved the sashimi salad with all the big chunks of fresh fish in a bright dressing. 

In the end, I enjoyed the items that I really wanted to eat and nothing else. Glad I ventured out to satisfy my tourists' gluttony.",2.0,DvcAC_nlKaTDsHcA8Slagw

Then they had a Cadillac suv, normally $30/day more, but they're willing to give it to me for $15/day more.  No thanks... You could give it to me for no extra charge...  They had nothing else.  Total bait and switch.

Pizza Chez Danny makes tasty pizza that will squash your late night craving. The crust is thin and crisp on the bottom, but soft on top.

The mixed cheese of the simple cheese pizza melts into yummy goodness and sits on a light dose of tomato sauce. With tax, the slice came out to around $3, and it was delicious.

We were going for a later meal, wanted something casual that wasn't a buffet and one of the casino employees mentioned this place had good pizza so the other non-New Yorkers were lured in (as someone who has had fantastic pizza here in NYC and Chicago I was skeptical).

We were promptly seated (for a party of 8 we had our own private dining area), and our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our table.  They have a small menu, but it catered to our different dietary restrictions (some were doing a Paeleo diet, some were doing low carb, some were vegetarian... it's hard to please 8 women sometimes!).

I ended up getting the sausage and peppers sandwich, the well suited, and a few of us tried the margharetia pizza .   The drink was nice and strong, and was the best part of my meal.  The sausage and peppers sandwich was flavorful, though the amount of bread was overwhelming to the amount of sausage and pepers within the sandwich so it was mostly bread.  The pizza, though we requested it be cut in 8 (usually their pies are cut in 6), was cut oddly so it wasn't an equitable division of pizza amongst our party (so we ended up cutting some slices in half), however the taste was bland and the crust though well done on the edges, could have been cooked a bit more and tasted a bit raw.

I went with a group of people who all experienced lackluster service and agreed on bland tasting, watered down food. For a restaurant which, in the past, had an amazing reputation for their genuine, traditional Mexican cuisine, most - if not all - of my party left generally uninspired and unwilling to return.  Despite what appeared to be the same authentic, expansive menu (which excited me beyond words) we all felt the actual food (and slow, rude service) was a waste of our time and money.  I could go into positives vs. negatives like I feel most reviews should have but, to be perfectly candid, the only positive I can think of is the cool set up and decor.  Since this could easily turn into a catastrophically negative review on a public forum I will refrain from writing anything more than:  1.  I should have tried the true staple Nopalas (I have concluded that finding this on a Pittsburgh menu is extremely rare) and 2. Don't rely on Casa Reyna's previous reputation because, for whatever reason, things have dramatically changed (possibly explaining our terrible experience?) ... do yourself a favor and go someplace else.

Our drinks, appetizers, and dinner. He asked us questions first what we were looking for or craving and what we didn't like. The drinks he brought out were so delicious and refreshing. I had a grapefruit drink and my boyfriend had a cucumber one. Sammy informed us that all the vodkas are in house infused with the fruits and veggies. Which is a good touch because they really were some of the best cocktails we had. Then our appetizer arrived. Sammy had ordered us the cheddar fondue which came with warm soft pretzels, sausage, apple slices, and of course cedar fondue.

Their snow crab legs tasted less than fresh (slightly fishy taste and lacking the sweetness of truly fresh shellfish) and it also had an odd sauce that reminded me of some amateur combo of ketchup-and-mayo-and-sriraca.  The Laksa Noodle ""soup"" had, instead of broth, a strange paste-like liquid base that was gloopy and unpleasant.  Their version of wasabi friend shrimp was no better than my local restaurant that sells it for half their price.

I liked the vibe here. There's a fair sized restaurant area and a large lounge with a cozy brick fireplace. It's usually packed Friday and Saturday nights.

The owner's son played with the Calgary Stampeders once upon a time, so there's lots of Stampeder memorabilia. It wouldn't be completely unrealistic to see some football players digging into some steaks while you're eating. 

My friends and I had pizza, Greek salad and Caesar salad. The Greek Salad was delicious and had some bonus creaminess to it. The Caesar (large) was nice and garlicky and came with a generous side of garlic toast.

We had the Ambrosia pizza (think spinach, artichoke hearts  feta) and the Athenian pizza (think feta and olives). Both had toppings that blended together in the most amazing way! I would order both again.

Today at 5:00 pm with open tables (so not super busy), we sat for 10 minutes before someone came to take our drink orders.

We really like the food here but as I mentioned, the service is ALWAYS POOR!  We want so badly for this restaurant to turn it around - but with every singe visit, we have received poor service. 

Someone from the management needs to pay attention, for now, while the economy is so strong, they can get away with poor service, but if the economy slips, people will take their business elsewhere.

This woman lacked any expertise. In fact, when we couldn't come to a clear idea of the centerpieces, I said how about I get all of the flowers through her and get the candleabra's through the other place we had conversed about, and she said, "" How about you just get nothing from us,"" and ripped up the order form into tiny pieces!

We came in right when it opened so it wasn't busy. Pretty comfortable, modern, ambience. I eat pretty much vegan style so I asked the waitress about vegan options. She recommended the hummus platter & also they can alter anything on the menu to make it vegan like eliminating any cheese or dairy in a dish etc. 

I ended up ordering the broccoli appetizer & hummus platter which tasted really good. My husband got the pretzel without cheese but they still put out a side of cheese just in case lol We also ordered a flat bread with tomato sauce, mushrooms & olives & potato dish. We got the hummus platter & pretzel & got full so fast. Between the two of us, we are lightweight consumers.

It was taking quite awhile to get the other dishes so luckily as we were waiting, my husband brought a lil medical mj chocolate bar from the dispensary the other day to hold him off. While we waited, we ended up getting full. The restaurant started filling up & our view of the basketball game that was blocked. 

 The waitress finally came out & said that the potato dish we ordered comes with butter & asked if he still wanted it & we were like no thank you. She should have asked us that when she took our order but at the same time we were actually relieved because we were already full. I asked about the other dish & she said it was coming out soon. 

Everything was pretty good there. The service was just a bit slow but maybe she was having a bad day or because it looked like business was starting to pick up.

Flavour-wise, the toppings were great but I found the hotdogs to be a bit tough to bite through - perhaps the it could have been cut a bit before serving. Fries were great. But by far the best and perhaps most surprising was the mini-donuts - we ordered a 6-pack of the nutella glazed with crush biscotti - wow - this was amazing!!! Donuts were made on the spot so they were warm and soft. Combined with the nutella - the whole thing melted in your mouth!

So - hotdogs were a bit mixed (Kraft Dog has better flavour) but the donuts were the best!",0.0,LPxx7_13EO7O_ZvLqEds0Q

The reason I love this particular location so much is because it's in a good area (Edgemont), the crowd isn't sketchy (like I sometimes find it to be in the other locations of Superstore) and depending on which day you go, it's not always insanely packed. I also love that they always carry every single last item on my grocery list, including the items on my 'Indian shopping list' such as basmati rice and chickpea flour. The produce section is always well stocked and it's rare that they run out of items before restocking them. The prices are always reasonable and they carry Joe Fresh clothing which I love to peruse!

The parking situation is also good and it's located in the Country Hills Plaza so you can pick up movie rentals, drop off your dry cleaning, pick up some pizza and even grab a couple of blizzards from Dairy Queen on your way home :)

The only difference between dinner and buffet is that you get only one order of short ribs and one or two other item.  That is a rip.  This is not a self serve buffet, where you get you own meat.  You have to actually order from the waitress and they get it and cook it in front of you. The problem is sometimes you want more of one item than another.  The items they have are very limited.

The reason why I gave two stars is because they only give you two small bowls of rice for an all you can eat .  Also I am Asian.

However, being that this restaurant is part of Caesar Palace's restaurants, I had higher expectations that their wait staff and front end staff would provide a nicer dining experience. I was wrong.

The restaurant is very cozy. Seating is limited, so I would suggest a reservation. The dinner menu changes daily, but overall, expect scrumptious seafood, pasta, and salad. First of all, the bread is delicious and fresh. We enjoyed snacking on it before receiving our antipasta  and salad. We ordered the Insalata Mista della Casa; the salad was the perfect blend of peppery and crisp greens. I would highly recommend ordering it. Both of the antipastas we requested were the standouts of our meal. The Carpaccio di Manzo literally melted in your mouth. The beef was incredibly fresh and sliced to perfection, and the Reggiano was a nice touch. The cozze was the best bowl of mussels either of us have ever devoured  (and I make mussels regularly at home). The taste was somehow delicate and full of flavor simultaneously. I can not imagine a better way to start off your dinner than with these two dishes. By the time we ate our main courses, we were already drunk on the flavors Dish Osteria has to offer. I ordered the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare. All of the shellfish was fresh and cooked to perfection. The spaghetti was a firm al dente, which is exactly how I prefer it. Amazing dish. My husband ordered the Saltimbocca di Vitello. The meat was delicious, but somehow the least impressive part of the plate. The butter potato gnocchi was seriously Heavenly! The texture was like fluffy marshmallow, and the flavor - buttery goodness. If I could eat it every day, I would. The brussel's sprouts were sauteed well and incredibly flavorful.

The staff can be rude- sometimes youre stuck standing around not knowing who to talk to while the staff chats with their friends - which you cant tell apart. Sometimes, youre greeted by someone right away.

Their staff turn around here is..alarming. I've never had the same piercer twice. When I ask about ____ who did mine (or a friends ) last time, they will say they no longer work there - this has happened with 3 or 4 different piercers, all within a year.

I got my vertical labret pierced here a year ago, and it was wonderful. The girl who did it was sweet,and spent a solid 20 minutes making sure it was at a proper angle - asking me to make different facial expressions to see how it would sit. 

My navel was a whole other experience. The girl (Ash i believe?) was rushing us, and not very nice. she marked it and didnt give me a chance to check it out in the mirror - which ended up being VERY crooked. She also pierced it too deep(length wise), and the jewelry she put in was subsequently too short and has made healing extremely difficult. I had to go through the (painful) experience of getting it changed at another shop. She also was quite offensive when I asked why she wasnt using clamps. She said ""GOOD piercers dont need clamps, and a GOOD piercer knows theyre dangerous."" Like she was insulted i had asked. Sorry, but all of my other piercings at this shop had clamps used so I was confused? 

Overall very hit and miss. I have a perfect vertical labret from them, and a crooked too-tight navel.",12.0,-iBrmbVYpQPIbku8tQADqg

He delivered spicy chicken salads, lamb salads (the dish we had last time), bruschetta, and hummus with pita.  So far, everyone loves it!

-The interiors were great. This might be odd but I love beautiful restrooms and their restroom is 5 stars. A restaurant that pays attention to its restroom is going to pay attention to other things as well... in my opinion. 
-Service was great too. My water was refilled over and over. I said we weren't happy with the meal so our waiter took the pasta off the bill. I'd give them a 3.5 since they had good service. 

Dinner: 
-House made pasta with shrimp, peas, and butter sauce. This was very salty and pretty bad. My friend and I said it seemed like defrosted costco shrimp and vegetables with butter over pasta. Texture of pasta was good but the dish was bad. 

-The tuna poke dish was in a japanese aioli over sesame oil apple slaw. Unfortunately the tuna just tasted like mayo. 

-The roasted brussel sprouts were really good. We wished they had been crispy on the outside instead of sort of wet and soft all around.

My rotisserie chicken sandwich was the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten. The chicken was tender, the cheese was melted yet still flavorful and the bun complemented the flavors as opposed to just being filler.

It was my first time visiting the restaurant and I was unaware that it was part of a chain. I think that speaks volumes about the establishment right there. I'm rating Bandera four stars instead of five because the prices were rather high for the size of the portions. That being said, the portions were what I would call ""a good size"" compared to say, Claim Jumper which has portions that are too large. Further, I think that Bandera could use a larger selection of beers and mixed drinks. 

Bandera was packed, something that surprised me for a Thursday night, and while I was able to get a table for two almost immediately, the background din made it difficult to hold a conversation or even clearly hear the server.

I thought I went to the wrong street but I checked the address and my map location and apparently it was supposed to be in front of me. What I saw was Valens restaurant and wondered if the place had closed down without notice. Apparently it's the same place but called two different names?  Anyway, I wasted about 20 mins bc of the name discrepancy.

The service, food and atmosphere was great. Water is always being refilled, and food was brought to our table in a timely manner. Although it's a rather small place, a reservation should do the job--we had 20 people come for our reservation!

There's quite a selection to choose from. It's also vegetarian and vegan friendly. It was nice to hear them clarify whether the vegetarian dish was to be made vegan.

I liked the bread they served at the beginning. It was very soft and not chewy at all! For my main meal, I got the frutti de mare. For the price, the portion was fair. I love seafood, so I quite enjoyed the dish. Sometimes there's too much tomato taste at other places, but the seasoning and sauce was done wonderfully here.

Overall, the food is good. The place is hard to find, but it all worked out in the end. :p",0.0,7cfgBUvOxqTmEELiGGjFSA

We were greeted and sat right away by the window which was nice.

We started off with the charcuterie board, it was really nice, a good selection of meat and some killer mustard. We decided to share some apps, the burrata with asparagus and ramp pesto, the grilled octopus and the crispy pigs ears. The ears weren't my deal but the burrata was killer, so creamy and the pesto was delishhhh. Now for the main event...the bestellen burger.... I have dreams about this burger. Dear lawd it is killllerrrrr. One of the best burger I've ever had in my life, yup I said it and it's true. The sharp raclette cheese, the sweet caramelized onions on a freshly made (like 3 hours earlier according to the server) brioche bun. I can't even tell you what my husband or friends had because I was too busy eating. If you go to bestellen get the burger. We finished off with the panna cotta and something with chocolate.

I was introduced to laminate flooring, new chairs, and fresh smell of paint. Also the fact that they were repairing the bathrooms during business hours was quite frank as you can hear the workers drilling away (it was really loud, quick tip may want to compete repairs before or after business hours). Now to the tacos, they were above average at best as nothing spectacular about it: cabeza, pastor, longaniza, and tripa. There was no salsa bar described by others but bottles of there salsa itself. I gave it an extra star as the price cannot be beat, $1.10 for the three tacos for tacos Tuesday special and $1.50 for the tripa taco! I believe all tacos are $1.50 on a regular day. Total paid was $4.90 for four tacos, which is unheard of nowadays as most tacos shops charge at least $2 per taco. You get more variety here and bang for your buck.

It was much better than we expected being a chain and after reading all of the negative reviews. It really exceeded our expectations. 

We started with the house margarita and they were delicious and strong. Probably better than any margarita I've had. I went with the shrimp tacos and they were really good, they also came with rice and beans. The whole meal was really filling. The pork tacos are also worth a mention if swine is your thing. If you're gonna try one thing, try the chimichangas. They were on the 'specials' menu that day and had beef and queso cheese, I'm craving these right now! 

The service left a little to be desired and I wish that chips and salsa were complimentary (they are $3).

a few friends and I came in to grab a quick and delicious meal at what has always been one of my favorite little places. got in just before the rush, which is always nice.

everything was fine until we reached the condiments section of the building process. the young lady has no sense of any kind of listening skills.
My fiance asked for hot salsa, cheese and guacamole... instead he got lettuce... i don't know on what planet lettuce and guacamole sound the same but whatever, maybe its because they are the same color.... when we cried out ""no!!!'"" the young woman looked up at us, she rolled her eyes at me and said ""what?"" thats what you ordered."" I looked at her and said, ""no, he said guacamole."" and the dialogue continued...

chipotle girl- ""do you want me to take it off?""
fiance -""yes please that would be great""
CG- ""there its off"" (still a mountain of lettuce covering the majority of the burrito)
fiance - ""can you please get at least the big pieces off please? or could you maybe remake it?""

instead of removing the rest or just simply remaking the item she literally takes guacamole and covers the remaining lettuce and rolls the burrito closed.

CG - ""its fine the way it is""

Last time i check its not your call as to if its ""fine"" or not. another girl standing on the line next to her made a face to me as if to say ""oh my god i'm sorry she's crazy""

the problem associate then with a fierce attitude tossed the item into a basket and almost knocked it off of the counter.

I've literally NEVER has a worse experience from any other establishment. the manager on duty was busy so i chose not to bother her - the restaurant was beginning to fill and i didn't want to take away from anyone else's experience.

In closing I'm pretty sure mouthing off to a customer isn't in the chipotle employee handbook... our entire group was completely taken aback by the complete disregard for any kind of professionalism. 

I know it seems silly but I was really upset by it.",2.0,pXKT_UKT2JCgTGuw0OBhbw

The first time I tried to go was over a year ago.  The waiter in front told me to go in the back...and the waiter in the back told me to go to the front.  It is very insulting when you're a single diner and you see through how much they don't want you there, so I left.

I gave this place a second chance today.  The seating was not very good.  I had the misfortune of seeing the waitress clean the Korean BBQ grill with me there and that was not an appetizing sight.  The seating area was also quite pathetic.  Because this place is linked with its next-door neighbour, the Chinese restaurant Made in China (they share staff, so they are probably owned by the same people), Korean Grill House's front seating area is tiny, cramped, and looks very unattractive, which detracts from the dining experience.

I ordered one of the lunch combinations, lamb chops with BBQ chicken, pork and beef.  The order took a little while to get there, but it was acceptable.  The food was a wildly erratic bunch.  The rice was great (fat grains, like in sushi), and the pork chops and chicken chunks were both seasoned perfectly.  The beef was half a step below, but still pretty good.  The problem was with the centerpiece of the dish.  The lamb didn't smell the greatest, and as anybody who's cooked lamb can tell you, there's skill in getting rid of the specific smell of the meat.  And Korean Grill House failed.  The lamb wasn't tender (which is surprising -- lamb is usually tender by nature), and the worst part is that it's very, very greasy.  This evening, a good seven or eight hours after eating the meal, I'm still tasting some residue stale lamb grease in my throat, and that's not a good thing.

I'd say, go to Made in China instead.  Cheaper food, faster service, better surroundings.",1.0,X5TCkfEdMOFEJID3KQZKHA

I said why?.. she went back in the kitchen where our plates were.. brought it to the front of our table around my friends and other customers!   Saying(you didn't eat all of the rice on your plate!!!!) at this point I was just mortified!!!
I replied by saying  if i violated your policy.. pull me aside or you explain that I will be charged more and I would have totally understood! I immediately went over to the chef and asked is this how you treat your customers. He quickly apologizes for her action! He came over to the table to defuse the situation and the bad experience from his employee.
Please understand my rant.. This is one of my favorite places in the city to eat!! I tell all of my co-workers, friends, and family to go there. So to get treated like this was horrible!

When people ask me where to go for Taco Tuesday, I always recommend Kennedy's. They are usually skeptical but don't take my word for it- go! The tacos are delicious and they have drink specials as well. Tacos are $1 (or were the last time I went last fall). 

I've taken my massive dog here to sit out on the patio and the service for both human and pup has been phenomenal. Now, I've also known others who have gone and had slow service but that personally hasn't happened to me. Perhaps I eat earlier than normal? I usually go before 6:30 p.m. 

I love the outdoor area when the weather is nice. In fact, I've seen the inside but don't think I've ever eaten inside. That's how much I love hanging outside Kennedy's! I highly recommend this spot for an out of the box location for Taco Tuesday.",0.0,sCbTM223gdRBZqNjMYiGyQ

A second is coming soon to Summerlin. Cafe Zupas has had great success in Utah and Arizona. They offer homemade soups, freshly made salads, paninis, and gourmet sandwiches. I was fortunate to receive an invite to a VIP party that allowed Frank and I to sample various menu items. All guests were warmly welcomed and encouraged to sample the Try 2 Combo, which comes with a whole sandwich, half soup and half salad for $7.99. The Kid's Meal Combo is $3.99.

Salads are made in front of you as you order, soups are made fresh daily in Cafe Zupas' kitchen, and sandwiches are fixed when you place your order. It is quite the assembly line. I chose the Tomato Basil soup with Orzo Pasta, topped with asiago cheese for .59, their signature salad Nuts About Berries and Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini. Frank had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. They got started on our orders right away, all components were added to our tray, we selected Brownies for dessert and our order came with Belgian Chocolate Covered Strawberries. By the time you pay your tab (ours was gratis on this visit), your order is complete and ready to be whisked away to a cozy table in the dining room.  

We dug into the soups first, the Tortilla soup is fantastic and loaded with flavor. It was so tasty Frank devoured it before I could snap a photo. The Tomato Basil was good, but less of favorite. It's quite sweet and very heavy on basil flavor. I hear the Wild Mushroom Bisque is not to be missed so I'll try that one next time.

Next, we tried the salads, I had the better of two with Nuts About Berries. It was loaded with fresh berries and topped with cinnamon almonds and lightly dressed with poppyseed dressing. It' a bit sweet, but not cloying so it was enjoyable. The BBQ Chicken salad was loaded with tomatoes, black beans, corn, olives, red onion and dressed with buttermilk ranch. What it lacked was BBQ chicken. There are ten other salads to choose from one is sure to strike your fancy.

Unfortunately, the sandwiches were the weakest link. This is a shame because their Italian Ciabatta bread is really fresh and delicious. The BBQ Pulled Pork tasted more like honey mustard that BBQ. It wasn't a very hearty sandwich. Sadly, the turkey wasn't very good. It tasted like prepackaged deli meat. I prefer freshly sliced deli meats. I expected actual artichokes on the sandwich, but it was a spread. That was my mistake, the menu clearly states a three cheese artichoke spread. I overlooked it. Truly, the bread is so good, I'd try the gourmet sandwiches again. I'm interested in the Asian BBQ Pork and the Vegetarian.

Dessert ended the meal on a pleasant note. I love Belgian Chocolate Dipped Strawberries so those alone wooed me, but the brownies were quite good and oh, so decadent. Gooey caramel and candy topped one and the other was more of a bar with coconut, nuts, chocolate and other goodness. 

The staff was incredibly friendly, they gave out dozens of prizes including water bottles and giftcards. Discounts and prizes will also be given out during their Grand Opening celebration on May 18. There are few places where a complete meal can be had for less than ten bucks, but it can be done at Cafe Zupas.",5.0,ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg

Honestly, the only critique I would have is that the overall the service needs to work on its timing. I felt like diners at the tasting were often waiting around for the next plate to happen. Perhaps this is because it's still a relatively new space and is still working out the kinks.

I was not familiar with their brunch set up and imagined a typical brunch menu. We were told we could eat at the buffet and order one entrée from their brunch menu. It wasn't until I started reading the reviews on Yelp that I even knew they had an omelet and waffle station... Our waitress seemed to have a slight attitude ... she didn't notify us, well at least my section of the table (there were around 12 of us )  of additional stations. When our table asked for clarification of entrees  on the menu she had even more of an attitude. I can't find the brunch menu online so I will do my best to describe my entree. It was a layer of French fires, a short rib, egg and then white bbq sauce layered in a bowl. It wasn't clear that this would all come in one bowl and essentially mixed together so when I read the description of the fried egg I asked to have it scrambled. The waitress then told me she can't guarantee that they can scrambled it ... to which I asked her if she could go ask .. instead of telling me she can't guarantee it. 
My friends ordered Mimosa's and felt as if they weren't coming frequently enough for the price. Another friend ordered an entrée without pork and then even asked the server when he dropped it off if it had pork twice and he said no ... the dish had pork in it. Another friend waited almost 30 mins to receive her food. That was her last straw with the service we received so we asked to speak to manager. Everybody in our party which included around 12 people received half off our bill. Now granted we were a large party and some people came in almost 30 mins after our original start time , I think that the service could have been better.
I'm glad that the manager rectified the situation , but I don't know if I would go back from brunch. 

On a positive note the buffet was pretty good but it would have been nice to know that I could have gotten an omelet and waffle. I would like to try their lunch menu that looks way more appetizing than what I had for brunch.",1.0,CfVdlk7VmhGA6YaJKmFEqg

First of all - if it's not plastic its metal. If it's metal - it's super difficult to just unscrew even with a wrench or plier.  While doing so I noticed a leak from the sink drainer at the top. Now what I thought was a simple p-trap replacement to resolve a potential clog issue seemed like a much bigger job!

So researched on Yelp and found E.H. Plumbing. Awesome reviews about service, response and pricing. Gave them a call and was immediately answered by Eric - mind you this is 10am on Friday morning. He gave me a lowdown on price to head over to the condo ~ $125 and then explained what I could be facing when it comes to fixing leaks and clogs for a kitchen sink.

He got there in couple of hours as promised and inspected the pipes. Discussed it and by then I was determined to replace the metallic pipes with industry accepted plastic PVC. While he wasn't convinced that clog was due to pipes he did suggest replacement into plastic. So got his tools and eventually got all the pipes out. No way I could have accomplished that but he handled it very professionally and gave pointers along the way.

Once the problem was identified to not be the pipes he attempted to snake the copper pipe running into the building. Source of issue was rusting of pipes in between the building. Anyway cleared the runs and put in the new pipes and now sink was clog free and draining as it should. Eric left right after the work and the total cost was about $200.

During the midst of this the neighbors kitchen got flooded. Apparently the building had used a single line for two kitchens. So essentially my condo line met at a T-junction with the neighbors line and then we shared a single line after.

Now here's where the 4 stars came into play for the review. Situation is while clog issue has been fixed with new pipes - can't really turn on sink without flooding neighbors floors. So called Eric and told him about the issue. Now he was great to have returned back to the condo after his other appointment but that's only because his other job was successful. Initially he forecasted waiting till Monday. That's a long time! Job is unfinished and I had already paid him!!

Not sure if he would have come by as he did if his other appointment took longer than expected. That I felt was a slight snag in accountability. 

However - once he came by - isolated the issue and replaced the neighbors pipes under the sink that blew out for free! 

Overall great experience with Eric and E.H. Plumbing.  Will definitely use him again! Thank you Eric!",1.0,V8M1Txtrx0SomcnhxfDM5A

The sauce was a deep red color and the meat tasted ok.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  This restaurant very much resembles a fast food Chinese take out place.  I wonder if they misspelled ""Carribean"" on their receipt on purpose when it's supposed to be 2 b's instead of 2 r's.  The steamed rice was on the hard side and not that great.

1. No New England style buns. They didn't even know what they are and the cook looked at me funny. To me this is insane, the bun is the second most important part next to the type of hot dog. A cheap potato bun doesn't cut it.

2. I asked for my bun to be buttered and toasted, again they were unable to do this and looked at me funny again.

3. I wanted my dog boiled and charred, again they don't do this. I am okay with boiled dogs and would have gone that route but they didn't even offer them boiled! Head scratcher on that one.

4. The only natural casing dog they carried came as a foot long. I did order this and it was good. I wish they carried natural casing dogs in regular size as I was not too happy with the price of having to order a foot long.

5. Service was slow, not friendly and they seemed rather irritated I asked question. Also ordering was confusing with all the people behind the counter you would think someone would want to take my order. They must not be that hungry for money.

On one positive I did enjoy the onion rings. They kind of reminded me of the ones served at Wahlburgers in Hingham Ma.

Any case, if you are from New England be prepared to be disappointed. I had high hopes seeing this was a franchise from New York, but then again New York is not part of New England.

This review may be longer than most of my reviews but I really need everyone to understand how much the staff anticipated our needs/desires.
Lets start with the front desk. I came in early the first day. I do mean early, there breakfast was still going. All I really needed was the shuttle to pick up my rental car, no problem. Told me what time to be in the lobby for the next shuttle, which was less than 20 minutes. So I just waited in the lobby. While I'm sitting there they called me to the desk and handed me my room keys! I'm like are you for real, but sure, that's great. 
I went to pick up my rental car then came back to take things up to my room. These rooms are very spacious. I was thrilled with a microwave and refrigerator as well. Ice machines available on each floor by the elevator. Just how convenient can it get.
Housekeeping is next. Wow, once again. The first morning we left a note for them to leave a couple of extra coffees. When we returned that night lets just say they made sure we had more than enough, regular and decaf. Everyday it was at least noon or later before we headed out for the day, and our room was still cleaned everyday. The last day, we stayed in the room till 2pm before we left and we returned around 6pm. To our surprise the room had not been refreshed, but we understood and didn't really need anything but coffee. Then a few minutes later housekeeping came by and all was perfect. All this without having to ask for anything.
Our last day, they where able to let us stay as long as we needed, since they still had availability that night. They just asked us to let them know when we where done.
The breakfast is pretty standard at Hampton inn. They always have some sort of egg and protein as well as waffles, cereals and pastries. I do wish that the Hampton chain would do something about the egg/protien selection.  Very limited and the eggs seem to always we way overcooked with very little flavor. This is a problem with the chain, and not this particulair hotel.   
My only complaint is about families with children. I love kids but please make them throw there candy wrappers away. Everyday the pool was littered with candy wrappers, and I know the hotel was cleaning the pool area. Sometimes we have to do our part. 
I see several comments on people making comments about the airport right next door.  Yes, if you are a light sleeper then the planes may just keep you awake, but I believe you would have to be a light sleeper.  If youve ever stayed at a hotel near LAX, then this is nothing compared to them.  
I will be back to Vegas and I will stay here again. Thank you for the opportunity for me to relax!",2.0,r1GQcCXHL3dF93OvDosOaw

Decent tobacco selection.

According to their website (Under Piercing - Process) they will sterilize your jewlery for you and pierce at a discounted price. Being that I am on a budget and have a sensitivity to nickel, I brought in my own titanium nostril screw because I've had a previous Stainless Steel piercing bubble, pop and bleed profusely and I had to take it out, whereas Titanium has been safe for me in the past. However upon arrival I was met with confusion about my inquiry and told that they only use their own jewlery, and that being pierced with their own titanium jewlery costs $95.00. I opted for Stainless Steel again because the girl (did not catch name, sorry!) assured me it was nickel free and that reactions are unusual. So, I hope the previous reaction to the nose ring was my fault somehow. I am honestly not trying to spend $95.00 on anything! I'm not balling like that.

My piercer was Nic and my experience was fine. He was polite and everything looked tidy. After piercing I was given some aftercare instructions and a small bag of salt.

It cost $65 to have a nostril pierced here, and I do find that pricey. I went elsewhere to have a nostril done last year and it was half the price. However, I'm not sure how piercing places determine their prices. Being to three different places to attempt the nostril piercing so far, there have not been any differences in friendliness or the apparent cleanliness of the place, while each place is double the price of the next. So I wouldn't discourage people from using this location based on the cost.

Overall my experience was satisfactory and my only complaint would be that the website does not reflect the practices of the business.",0.0,RLtB1CV0KT4ocJQcM2efaA

They also had crepes (which looked delicious) and other fruity drinks. Other toppings, other than boba, for your drink as well.

The front gates do not close. ever--- they will tell you they close at dusk and open at sunrise, but they only actually worked for about 1 month of the time i lived here. When you ask them about this they state that they are having trouble with them, and have had 3 different companies come out to see them.. The walking gates are never closed either, and even if they do, the front fence  by the mail room and fountain is rusted, so you could get thru it if you were a smaller person


   There are homeless people that come in and rummage thru the garbages , when chandler, one of the office staff was asked about this she told me to call glendale pd next time..

  Speaking of glendale pd they are there on a montly basis, and  when this is brought to the attention of the office staff ,to see if me as a single woman getting home at 1 or 2 am needs to be worried about anything, they never have any explanation,aside from the fact that yes there has been some dificulty with one of the residents..
  
   The mainatance ppl are extremely adept at smoking and driving golf carts, tho they seem to do little else...I have seem more control panels on the buildings open then i can count, the pool gates  dont always open from the inside, you need a key on the outside lock to get out from the inside, there is more light bulbs in the ouside lighting out then that actually works, and that is for the light fixtures that are still standing-- there was on that got knocked down on july 4 weekend and was still lying on the ground when i moved out on the last weekend of august.  oh and some of the other things ive found while walking my dogs on the property is used needles lying by the gym, swarms of bees, a million ferral cats...

    Which brings me to the office staff.God help you if you have a problem because the 3 of them couldnt find their way out of a paper bag-- Chandler cant remember anything form one day to the next, you can have packages that get delivered , but the staff cant seem to find them because they label them with the wrong apartment number....

They will call and tell you that the people around you complained that you were noisy and they dont know if you were having a party or not,but you need to be more considerate of your neighbors--A direct quote from chandler, and when you contact her to tell her that there must be a mistake because you work until 1 am, and werent even home that night, she has no idea what you are talking about... when i gave my notice I was given a move final price by chandler,  then a day later i was called by another office staff who gave me another number for my final rent. When i questioned this she got huffy with me and stated that she was the book keeper and did i want her to go over the books with her.. When i state no, i just wanted to know how i got 2 different numbers in 2 days,especially after a call to verify that i was moving out and when because apparently chandler got confused at to what i wanted and the dates of these things, even thought they have a form you fill out...that i handed to chandler...when i paid my last rent for 3 days of september i was given a third price,which happened to be the least expensive.  If you havent guessed i cannot say enough negative things about this place-- it was a means to an end for me, but i wouldnt let anyone rent here ever















  The maintanence people seem to be very adept at smoking and driving golf carts around, but i rarely see them do any work--I had a upper unit that had a ac that leaked onto my floor between my kitchen and bathroom,.when i asked them about this last year when i moved in i was told that this is normal for arizona,   when it happend again this year i called and spoke with chandler again, who also told me that it is completely normal for arizona.. when i explained to her that i have lived in az for 12 years and never had this occur anywhere but here she told me that it is their units specifically, and normal.

Fairmount, or 2) Montreal bagels v. NYC style. What I can offer is a whole-hearted endorsement of all things made of carbohydrates. 

Montreal bagels are delicious. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a moron, or a liar. They are sweeter than the NYC style, and a lot less doughy. I find that less dough- equals a better carb to cream cheese ratio. 

Fairmount bagels are wonderful. You will have to wait in line for them- but they are worth it. I ordered a to-go bag of 12. There are a lot of flavors to choose from including: All-dressed, Garlic, sesame, chocolate, cinnamon-raisin, ""a sweet bagel"" (whatever that is), poppy seed, plain, etc. My favorite was the garlic bagel, second places goes to all-dressed. 

Fairmount does not have a toaster- so you'll have to eat your bagels ""raw"" or bring them home and prepare them. Fairmount sells cream cheese - in a few different varieties, and can direct you to a good lox shop down the street. They also sell day-old bagels at a discount, already helpfully arranged in bags, to the side of the counter.

Bagel-sellers speak English. They are excellent at handling complex orders and are efficient at gathering all of your beloved demands. 

Open 24 hours a day. It's a good place to shop for vacation ""presents"" for your jealous friends and family. 

Last word of advice: Fairmount bagels keep well in the freezer. If you freeze you bagels- you just need to zap them for approximately 30 seconds- and as if they are fresh again.",2.0,AII0Sf_7xsxf4hMRNCPZ-Q

Jennifer came, asked us what we wanted, and she walked back and forth in the opposite direction of where the soda machine was at. Another nice gentlemen came to make sure that we were already taken care of, and thinking back we should've switched waiters while we had the chance.

This Distillery coffeeshop is some 50 feet high with gargantuan windows and a large green door that's BFG friendly. Walking in will draw your eyes up; it's an overwhelming space.

Their mezzanine is fabulous and I would probably push someone over a ledge for a seat. Their delightful whitewashed walls often feature charming local art. There is a patio out front (which unfortunately faces an abominable sculpture), which is pretty busy in the summer. There's no wifi, so it's not a place to work, but an enjoyable place to chill.

The exception: on two separate occasions the same employee has given me inaccurate information. Both times I was looking at some dirt cheap entry level catching gloves. Both times this guy has come up and told me that it's an incredible deal on top of the line gear. 

Now if you know anything about goalie gear, you know that there's a HUGE difference between a $150 entry level glove on a clearance rack and a $450 top of the line glove. I don't know if he was intentionally BSing or just clueless.

______________________________________________________________________________

Edit: I'm knocking off two stars. I had two experiences at this store in the last few months that I was living in Madison that really soured me on the place. 

1) I had them install a new pair of cowlings on my skates and they did a lousy job. There were two issues: 1) One of the cowlings was clearly pinched too tight. When I pointed this out, they referred to the fact that it was under warranty instead of trying to make it right. 2) A rivet in the other skate wasn't installed correctly. It sticks up a good quarter of an inch. This was a really, really obvious problem, and I'm deeply annoyed that they didn't get it right.

2) I purchased a very pricy pair of knee guards. One of them burst a seam just a few months after I bought it, but fortunately it was under warranty from the company. I brought this to their attention and waited for a replacement. And waited. And waited. Months went by and nothing was happening. The manager assured me that they would get me a replacement as soon as possible. I assumed that the manufacturer was completely out of stock and that they were making their best efforts to secure the replacement. They weren't. I ended up moving to Pennsylvania and going into another Hockey Giant where I saw those exact same knee guards on display. Ultimately, the Madison store was able to transfer my credit, so I finally got the replacements that I'd waited so long for. It really pissed me off, though, that these knee guards existed in their system and that they didn't figure out a way to get me some in a timely manner.",2.0,GoeHBmVr2bb395Zb74vU_w

At last, she was able to book a next day couples massage when that's all my schedule could fit in. Once we got there, the woman at the counter was very nice and guided the way. The lounges (at  least the women's) were nice, clean, and cozy with lockers, showers, hair supplies, and a sauna; though, the magazines could have been better placed so you don't have to bend over and risk exposing breast or genitals to obtain one while sitting and waiting for the therapist. When we got to the room, the ambiance was relaxing and what you would expect for a massage. My boyfriend and I both agree, the massages were great, and much better than a different resort spa we had gone to that I won't mention. That being said, one of the therapists's stomach was gurgling throughout the whole hour; I could even hear it on my end even though it was my boyfriend's therapist. He stated it got to the point where he would try to predict when it would happen again; because, at the end of the gastric rhapsody, a large belch would erupt. This occurred 4-5 times. Nice woman, nice massage, but we were left wondering if she had forgotten to take her GERD medication that morning or if we were both at risk for getting gastro. In addition, my therapist was coughing throughout the massage. There was no nose sniffling, which reassured me it was likely allergies or a post-infectious cough that lingered. Since we are both pretty low-key, we just laughed about it and joked how we may have created a super bug being in a small room complete with upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms (though I'm sure many others would be perturbed). The only real thing that perturbed me is when I went to pay for the massage afterwards. The bill was right, but I received a thank you card for ""Matthew & Sandy."" That would be fine, except for my name isn't Sandy. I had just spent a couple hundred dollars, if you want to go to the effort of giving a card, at least get the name right. I would have preferred not getting one at all. It's pretty impersonal to have your boyfriend's name with another woman's name on a card after I just paid for it (the reservation name was right, however, and so was the credit card name). Afterwards, we went and relaxed by the pool which was nice. But keep in mind you might have to get food and drinks from the indoor bar because by the time we arrived, they were already doing last call at the pool side bar. P.S. I purposefully left out employee names (except for Laura, since she was so kind), but do have them as references if need be.

On the outside of the restaurant is a big sign that says ""FUSION FOOD"".  The place was also described as a typical Japanese cafe.  Have been to Japan three times and there is nothing that indicates a typical cafe except for a tiny place in Osaka that had curry and 5 other things on the menu.  

I would recommend removing that banner.  The food is not fusion and it detracts from what you are really trying to do.  The service here is decent, but I'm still struggling with the typical cafe thing.  The menu is a mix of some Izakaya style dishes...Japanese curry and the Japanese version of Hanbaga, with a Korean pork and kim chee highlighted by some desserts that you might see in a cafe/coffee shop.  I still have had much better parfaits and desserts.  

Heard the chef/owner is from Sushi Roku and I wish him the best.  Focus on the food and forget the fusion.  The Japanese Hamburger and the Curry is a great start for the concept.  The creative desserts can be another aspect, but go the extra mile and do something more.  I get the impression of settling on a little of this and that.

I would probably go back once or twice a year unless the food improves.  Get rid of the metal chopsticks as well.  Wooden is preferable in a Japanese establishment.  Consider share plates or chopstick holders as well so your customers have a place to put them rather than directly on the table.",3.0,t3dxO3Y0MMfdqcaVYfeUPA

The scheduling was very easy, and I had asked that there be some extra time allotted as the digital display behind the odometer was not changing and I needed help with that. When I arrived, I was sent to the Customer Service and Bert Neal was the Consultant assigned to help me. First off, he told me that he couldn't have the digital display checked as there was not enough time allocated for it... this was after he couldn't figure out who was supposed to be assigned to help me, and it turned out to be him. I told him when I made the appointment 2 weeks earlier, I knew I would be back in Las Vegas and needed that looked at so I had asked for the time to be allotted when I made the appointment. He kept telling me he didn't know what I was talking about and so forth. Anyway, he said he'd look at the car and check it out after the oil change. He didn't have the faintest clue about the car or what I needed looked at and so his time spent there was a complete waste. Also, the oil change was done in about 10 minutes, but the car was brought back to me unwashed and not vacuumed out. I would have thought for a new car, there might be some perk when you're getting your recommended service, like at the Lexus dealership. There was none. Bert then got in the car and proceeded to tell me that the S, T, TR, W, E button was working and I informed him that wasn't even what I was talking about. He had zero clue. He finally took it to Concierge service where the nice young woman immediately showed me how to change the digital display. The last thing I asked was about the center console where your arm rests as the leather started to wrinkle after 6 months. I had asked about it and Bert immediately said it was my fault for using lotion and putting my arm on the arm rest and it wasn't under warranty. He said I could talk to the manager but that it wouldn't be covered. He did tell me I could take the car to St. George, UT, where I now live, but have never had the car for any service and see if they might cover it. I was like, 'why would a dealership, who didn't sell me the car, cover anything and why won't you take care of it here?' Honestly, I was so incredibly disappointed with Bert Neal. I spent 65K on a car that the salesman worked hard to ensure my sale went through well and then some lazy guy who is a sales consultant, could ruin the entire reputation of the Henderson dealership. I had to finally ask Bert if he was going to go get Roger, the Manager, or do I have too? He went to get Roger, and I can tell you, Bert wasn't happy about having to go get me any help. I'm thinking, I've spent a ton of money, I'm a good customer, why do I have to deal with some jerk who was talking condescending to me and treating me like I was an idiot, when he was the one who didn't have a clue what was going on? Roger came out and spoke with me. He was extremely pleasant and wanted to get things fixed. He did not agree with Bert on the lotion issue and informed me how to better take care of that issue. I will say that if I have to have service at the Henderson dealership, I will ask to NOT have Bert Neal work with me. His attitude toward having to look something up or move away from his desk was like I was a big inconvenience. It really does hurt your customer satisfaction to have an employee like that. Also, I would suggest that at the very least, a light vacuum be done of the cars which are in for service that is under warranty, like the Lexus dealership does. I do love the Corvette, but the service behind it has been minimal. Thank you. I feel bad giving a '1' star, but Bert was one of the worst customer service people I've ever dealt with. Roger and the girl from the Concierge were amazing so the '1' star is for the Sales Consultant Bert Neal. Otherwise, I would give the service for the oil change a 3 and Concierge and Management a 5 star.

An update to this review done on 8-28-2017:  I was able to get the car in for the part and Roger in Management helped with that process.  He was great to work with.  Steve was the new Sales Consultant I worked with and was amazing also. They got the car in, fixed and got me on my way quickly.  Thank you to the great people in management and scheduling, who helped to get this issue resolved for me.  I appreciate it so much.",2.0,-S2rg1vEtMq5JdI3wK0IJQ

I got a gel manicure. If you can even conifer me having a manicure. I wasn't asked if I wanted my nails cut or filed, wasn't asked what shape. I got a quick file down.

I recently moved into the neighborhood and was pretty stoked that there were several food establishments on Coventry. A few weeks ago I had finished up at the gym that left me with a handsome appetite and ordered carry-out from Hunan Convetry - first and last time.  

I ordered crab rangoons, shrimp with honey walnut, Kung Pao beef, and pork chow fun ... (I was a little *hungry* :-P). It was a carry out order, and they were promptly ready for pick-up. I got back home super excited and immediately inhaled the rangoons; you can't really screw those up: it's fried wontons with cream cheese and sweet chili sauce. 

I don't think my palate is salt-biased, but this was the first time (in a long time) that I ADDED salt, among other things, to my shrimp and pork entrees. Chow fun ranks pretty high on my list of comfort foods - the broad doughy noodles full of flavor I expected were nothing more than tasteless oil-laden folds of pasta. I have my food issues, always cleaning my plate, always keeping leftovers, and never wasting (there are too many hungry people out there for me to be cavalier). Well, these two entrees ended up in the trash (did I mention I was STARVING when I ordered?). As for the beef, I tried my best to salvage my $$$ by re-purposing it the next day.

I would have done better picking up a frozen entree by Ina Garten or Trader Joe's.",6.0,M6v37Q3fCL0rxUXT-pNvFQ
